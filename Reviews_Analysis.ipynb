I\\'m not sure if it\\'s a scam, or if this software is really just that problematic, but somehow a $3,350 mobile deposited check DISAPPEARED from any/all activity on my account. Since Novo\\'s support team didn\\'t respond quickly enough, I contacted my client directly to have them cancel the check. I met my client at the bank and watched the clerk cancel the check in front of us. Yet somehow, NOVO DEPOSITED THE CANCELED CHECK TO MY ACCOUNT?! If I hadn\\'t known better, I might be spending money that wasn\\'t mine to spend. If I had money moving in/out of this account any faster, then I might not have noticed either of these issues AT ALL. I have frozen my virtual card, physical card, and am slowly moving my funds over to a bank account where I can visit in-person when I have an issue.To top it all off - the support section of the mobile app hasn\\'t been working for weeks. I can only access support tickets from a desktop browser. Plus, everytime I add a comment or reply back it sends me a notification as if someone from the Novo support team has actually responded to my issue. Last, but certainly not least, when someone DID respond to my VERY detailed messages they asked for more \"clarity\". It\\'s exhausting to deal with this app and surprising that it\\'s got so many partnerships and integrations given the experience I\\'ve had.',\n",

After having the account for over a year and completing several deposits and withdrawals, I received a larger check from a customer, which they would not let me remotely deposit because it was above my limit. It took me 5 days to finally get someone on the phone from customer support to see if they could adjust my account, and their advice was to go deposit it in one of my personal accounts (which I can't do because it is written to a business not me personally) and that they couldn't help me. I asked if that is what they advised all their customers that have larger sales transactions to do, and they explained no they just weren't willing to help me because I didn't meet their standards.

But when you have any issues whatsoever, their support is absolutely awful and almost nonexistent.I\\'ve been needing to pay my tax bill to the IRS which was due today (December 18th). I reached out to Novo on November 28th so I can enroll in the EFTPS. The EFTPS requires your bank to confirm your identity through your EIN number and your bank has to notarize this form. I asked the IRS how long this process should take and they informed me that the bank should be able to have this done within a day\\'s time. Great. Or so I thought.It is now December 19th and I am still unable to make my payment to the IRS because Novo\\'s support system is awful. I scanned the form as a PDF by December 3rd per their request. They sent me the document to fill out through their system on December 6th. I immediately finished it. I did NOT hear anything from them so by December 12th, I follow up asking what is the issue? Jasmine who is my point of contact then tells me she is waiting for the form to be filled out on Novo\\'s end. I am getting anxious now because the clock is ticking and it has taken now two weeks with NO solution.December 14th Jasmine informs me the EIN is incorrect. I see that there is a typo on my end (this is my fault and I take ownership of that) and resend the form immediately with the correct EIN number.She then informs me that same day that the EIN I sent is incorrect. Um, what? I tell her she must be mistaken and send her the document from the IRS that has my EIN information for my business. She responds to be on December 15th stating that Novo does not have that EIN number, and has a different number instead. I am thinking, maybe they used my social security? Nope. It\\'s some random number I have never seen before. Well, unfortunately, they need to verify the current EIN number. How am I supposed to confirm this when I literally just told you I don\\'t know what it is nor never seen the last four digits you sent me? She then tells me I should be able to see it on my account dashboard, I send her a screenshot asking where? And then she tells me \"I let our account team know that viewing the complete EIN is not straightforward.\" Okay? So?It is now December 17th and I follow up again because I hear no update and ask to expedite the process. I hear nothing. It is December 18th and I follow up again and call Novo. The phone agent tells me there is nothing we can do. I call the IRS asking for help on this and they informed me that it is incredibly odd that this is taking SO much time and that it should take a day, maybe a few days at max. It is now December 19th and I still have no resolution. At this point, I could have opened another business bank account with someone else and easily have had this done. I feel so stupid that I did not do this in the first place. I no longer will recommend Novo as a bank, and will be closing my account.It is a shame because the product is great when it works, but I cannot in good faith recommend this bank anymore. I have recommended this bank to many of my clients and audience and will no longer do so.',\n",

I consider this totally unacceptable, their are to many banks still around with 24/7 phone access3-No ATM Network allowing free withdrawals, which wasn\\'t an issue until recently, because initially Nova refunded all ATM fees, now only 2 a month. Basically our Company is subject to ATM fees because Nova is still a small fish on Training Wheels.4-No Zelle access on their accounts. Nova does offer a free transfer feature to and from connected account withouta fee. But this option will takes days to receive or to be received. Yes, they have a same day expedited option which \"Charges\" an additional fee. But when I used this option, the still posted the next after paying the fee. Since it takes 2/3 days to be contacted by customer service I had no support during this failed transaction.5-Nova doesn\\'t offer 2 day advance posting for direct deposits, in fact their deposits posts slower than any bank I have used in the last 20 years, not good if you\\'re a small business with cash flow challenges or a medium size businesses who wants timely access to it\\'s liquid capital.6-No interest bearing savings account, which isn\\'t competitive since there are plenty of other internet banks offering 4% or more on their savings accounts, Nova gets another poor mark on this point. They do offer sub accounts which would be very helpful and productive, but without interest the sub account feature benefits Nova much more than its business customers.In closing, Nova is a nice group of people, those that I have had the opportunity to engage with.But overall as a business person who has been on their platform for almost 3 years I give them a failing grade and wouldn\\'t recommend them at this time.
