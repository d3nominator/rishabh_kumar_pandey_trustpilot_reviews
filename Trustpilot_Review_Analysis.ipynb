Jasmine who is my point of contact then tells me she is waiting for the form to be filled out on Novo\\'s end. I am getting anxious now because the clock is ticking and it has taken now two weeks with NO solution.December 14th Jasmine informs me the EIN is incorrect.

Um, what? I tell her she must be mistaken and send her the document from the IRS that has my EIN information for my business. She responds to be on December 15th stating that Novo does not have that EIN number, and has a different number instead. I am thinking, maybe they used my social security? Nope. It\\'s some random number I have never seen before. Well, unfortunately, they need to verify the current EIN number. How am I supposed to confirm this when I literally just told you I don\\'t know what it is nor never seen the last four digits you sent me? She then tells me I should be able to see it on my account dashboard, I send her a screenshot asking where? And then she tells me \"I let our account team know that viewing the complete EIN is not straightforward.\" Okay? So?It is now December 17th and I follow up again because I hear no update and ask to expedite the process. I hear nothing. It is December 18th and I follow up again and call Novo. The phone agent tells me there is nothing we can do. I call the IRS asking for help on this and they informed me that it is incredibly odd that this is taking SO much time and that it should take a day, maybe a few days at max. It is now December 19th and I still have no resolution. At this point, I could have opened another business bank account with someone else and easily have had this done. I feel so stupid that I did not do this in the first place. I no longer will recommend Novo as a bank, and will be closing my account.It is a shame because the product is great when it works, but I cannot in good faith recommend this bank anymore. I have recommended this bank to many of my clients and audience and will no longer do so.',\n",

Some other things I love: -- They actively solicit feedback from members on how they can improve, and then actually follow through with those improvements. -- They continually add apps and integrations to help automate processes. -- The app is thoughtfully designed and truly functions as an extension of the website with access to the same features. -- The ability to automate a percentage or particular dollar amount from every deposit towards \"Reserves\" of your choosing, in our case business travel and taxes.

Because of the following reasons:1-The debit card has limited use since  many sites view Nova\\'s Debit Card as a prepaid card and won\\'t accept it, including major accounts with whom I have contracts. 2-No telephone access to a live customer service person for 48-72 hours after a problem or help is needed. I consider this totally unacceptable, their are to many banks still around with 24/7 phone access3-No ATM Network allowing free withdrawals, which wasn\\'t an issue until recently, because initially Nova refunded all ATM fees, now only 2 a month. Basically our Company is subject to ATM fees because Nova is still a small fish on Training Wheels.4-No Zelle access on their accounts. Nova does offer a free transfer feature to and from connected account withouta fee. But this option will takes days to receive or to be received. Yes, they have a same day expedited option which \"Charges\" an additional fee. But when I used this option, the still posted the next after paying the fee. Since it takes 2/3 days to be contacted by customer service I had no support during this failed transaction.5-Nova doesn\\'t offer 2 day advance posting for direct deposits, in fact their deposits posts slower than any bank I have used in the last 20 years, not good if you\\'re a small business with cash flow challenges or a medium size businesses who wants timely access to it\\'s liquid capital.6-No interest bearing savings account, which isn\\'t competitive since there are plenty of other internet banks offering 4% or more on their savings accounts, Nova gets another poor mark on this point. They do offer sub accounts which would be very helpful and productive, but without interest the sub account feature benefits Nova much more than its business customers.In closing, Nova is a nice group of people, those that I have had the opportunity to engage with.But overall as a business person who has been on their platform for almost 3 years I give them a failing grade and wouldn\\'t recommend them at this time.

            " - Unfortunately I’m probably going to figure out a new business banking solution. Super easy to set up and the feature set is good. There haven’t been many bugs but the ones I’ve had have all been important:1. Bank goes offline for hours without so much as a message about it.2. I send a client an invoice. Client clicks on the download pdf and gets an error. Asks me for a pdf and I get the same error.3. Scheduled invoices did not send.Customer service is lackluster at best.\n",
            " - A decent basic free business bank, but have regular issues with vendors being flagged as fraud (declined transactions) and then extremely poor support time to resolve these issues. Also no domestic wires which most other fintech banks still allow.\n",
            " - Really easy to set up. Works as intended most of the time with no disruption to business related activities.One minor issue I've had over the year using Novo is understanding how deposited checks using the mobile app reflect in analytics. Between the pending time and cleared time, the amount deposited gets moved to the reserves. This only impacts my ability to know which month the amount is credited if deposited near the end of a month.\n",
            " - I had wanted a solution for starting up my small business and Novo had everything I needed and then some. Invoice, ACH transfers, integration with other platforms like Square and Quickbooks.\n",
            " - A great solution for a small online business. No hidden fees and they do what they say they will do. One star off because when logging in using the browser, you have to get the authentication code via text, email doesn't work even though it's listed as an option.\n",
            " - I chose Novo bc of the ability to create \"profit first\" style reserves to manage cashflow and set aside profit for myself. It's great that once you set up the reserves and percentages, Novo automatically divides deposits between the reserves.I have had no issues with the site or app thus far.\n",
            " - My favorite for online business banking so far. The only knock I have against them is low limits, as we expect to make a high volume of payments in the future to our 1099 contractors.\n",
            " - Lowers the barrier to entry for starting a business. There can be a lot of daunting steps to set one up, Novo does a great job of making banking setup simple and pain-free. Further, the app has useful insights, makes check deposit easy, and the reserves feature is great for organizing and allocating.\n",
            " - I've had a fantastic experience with this Bank. As a small business owner and entrepreneur they have really made it easy to set up my accounts, pay vendors, and manage my money easily on the go. It really goes a long way that they do not charge you fees, and the referral program is one I have already taken advantage of.\n",
            " - Novo is a excellent service for small and Startups. The onboarding process is simple and faster than a local bank. The app is full of financial services and features that will help you manage your finance with easy, and the $0 fees aren't comparable with any local bank or financial institution. Highly recommended!!\n",
            " - I highly recommend Novo for business owners. Their self-service resources are informative and reliable, and they help me quickly get the information I need.Novo's customer support is also very responsive and helpful. I've contacted them several times for specific inquiries and they promptly and patiently answer my queries.The Novo banking app is easy to navigate. I especially like being able to create reserves for things I want to set aside funds for and having the ability to set how much I want to put into each reserve.\n",
            " - Easy interface and user experience. I was worried about transitioning to an all online bank but I have yet to run into any issues.\n",
            " - We were a small business and found that Novo was a perfect match for our startup needs.  The services offered were extremely helpful to us including invoicing, EFT transfers, bill pay, and reserves.  The only negative we experienced was the inability to perform domestic wire transfers; but we were able to work around that limitation.\n",
            " - I love this bank because it doesn’t charge me fees when I travel, it has built in apps/features that I like, I love the design of their dashboard because it makes it easy for me to do and understand banking, and they even gave me a loan not too long ago. I have recommended to several people and will continue to do so.\n",
            " - Novo.co is different from anything else I have ever used.  I love their reserves system.  It keeps me organized and I can segment my monies in different categories.\n",
            " - Novo is the best business Bank with features that most banks don't have. One feature I really like is the invoicing built right into Novo, you can send invoices that can be paid into your account!\n",
            " - I have enjoyed working with NOVO because they provide peace of mind.  No processing fees or maintenance fees like other banks. Thank you NOVO keep being amazing!!!!!\n",
            " - Novo is a great safe bank as long as you want online experience, no fees, Quickbooks, and many more integrations, no paper checks (Novo will send a check for you).\n",
            " - Novo is great and very much legit. They’re able to be connected to many different apps and services such as PayPal, square invoicing, stripe, etc. I’d recommend!\n",
            " - I love using the reserves! It makes it so easy for me to run my business as Profit First and keep all my categories separate. It is so nice at the end of the year to see my tax account and be able to pay it without wondering where it should come from.\n",
            " - The simplicity and speed of the uncluttered interface enables me to achieve my tasks quickly and easily.   The only thing I miss is the ability to accept payments from external clients\n",
            " - I like this business account although Im not using all of its other products to the best of my ability due to lack of funds. it offers Alot just Wish I had the funds to make it work for me. But tensing hopeful.\n",
            " - No nonsense, just good banking experience. Services offered fulfill my needs. Fast response when needed. So far only good things to say.\n",
            " - Novo provides great service and continues to provide useful innovations. I have used them exclusively for my business since 2020.\n",
            " - Streamlined app and website that connects me to all the important things I need to keep my business running and functional.\n",
            " - My user experience and the level of platform stability and customer support Novo has continued to provide have far exceeded my expectations.\n",
            " - Novo is reliable and quick. They have added security whenever there's unusual activity and they are very helpful when needed!\n",
            " - I love being able to do everything completely online. I also like that I get my deposits from online sales quickly.\n",
            " - Online interface is intuitive and user friendly.  These folks really understand how to make life efficient for small businesses!\n",
            " - Novo has been instrumental in being very responsive to my inquiries and I love how informative they are about incentives, benefits and keeping me abreast of my activities.  Highly recommend this online bank!\n",
            " - Support at NOVO is always timely and leads to resolution quickly.\n",
            " - Don’t you dare take any loan from this company. They claim interest rate is 3% every month but it increaseses by multiples if 3 every month. By end of 6th month you will be paying 18% but they don’t tell you that. Unless you pay your full loan in one month which beats the logic, you are in for it. A bunch of greedy thieves. Don’t even sign up with their lame business bank!!\n",
            " - I've never had an issue with this bank and the tracking if my money is great\n",
            " - i didnt have any issues with Novo until further notice.\n",
            " - no fees, great  bank and they have advanced technology\n",
            " - This bank is great!  I like the fluidity of transactions and the options.\n",
            " - I like the platform. It keeps track of spending and income with no issues.\n",
            " - Failed to respond effectively to their inability to accept a wire transfer.  Took days of me following up!!! No response to my note to the CEO\n",
            " - Lost my password (according to Novo, it was wrong when I know it was not) so when I hit the reset password button and answered all the security questions correctly, the Novo app keeps telling me something went wrong. Communication with Novo reps is a nightmare. So here I am with my business funds in limbo and no one to call cause Novo has no phone numbers. This is a nightmare \"Banking\" system. STAY AWAY!!!! go to a credit union and they offer basically same service as Novo for free too.\n",
            " - Quick response to inquiries, good and responsive app.\n",
            " - The banking with this bank has been seemless.\n",
            " - so far so good. wish they did paper check books is all.\n",
            " - I have not been able to use my novo account. I was wanting to try and establish it again  i have tried to chdnge my password. Says reset and the the page says it timed iut. How I just got to it. It is awful that so many have abused the system no onecan use it.I like novo and I tell my friends.\n",
            " - The payee I have sent money monthly for years suddenly would not set up for payment. They were grayed out. Repeated attempts to update the payee failed. Had to uninstall and reinstall the same info. Spent 10x how long this should take. Support doesn’t exist.\n",
            " - I am leaving novo.I received a deposit for a small job and was unable to put it in the bank because it exceeded Novo's maximum deposit limit... what is this, a bank for ants?\n",
            " - Love NOVO! I refer all my clients to them!\n",
            " - A terrible bank.  You can not do a real wire transfer at all.  All in all a bad experience in all ways.  There are much better choices. Avoid.\n",
            " - Novo is the bomb. No cap.\n",
            " - Excellent communication and good practices\n",
            " - fast, efficient\n",
            " - No more free atm - only reason I chose this bank\n",
            " - So far so good! A solid and easy banking experience. One thing I wish I could have is a separate savings account but they do have something \"similar\". Have been using them for a few years now and very happy with no issues.\n",
            " - I never thought I could love a bank, yet here I am, loving you, Novo. My single member LLC has been a customer for 2 years, and initially I was nervous to have an online only bank, but that's turned out to be a non-issue. Not having fees for anything is a game changer when you're a business of one. All of my company's income is on a project basis (we represent photographers and directors), and since we pay a lot of crew for every project it's a game changer that we're not charged for ACH/ wire payments. Having only the option to send a paper check (at no cost) is frankly embarassing in (nearly) 2024, so this is a key feature for me. Some other things I love: -- They actively solicit feedback from members on how they can improve, and then actually follow through with those improvements. -- They continually add apps and integrations to help automate processes. -- The app is thoughtfully designed and truly functions as an extension of the website with access to the same features. -- The ability to automate a percentage or particular dollar amount from every deposit towards \"Reserves\" of your choosing, in our case business travel and taxes. The opportunities for improvement are few - namely that the selection of expense categories is set. Because their categories don't always align with our actual expenses it would be helpful to have the ability to create/ change your own expense categories.\n",
            " - I've banked with Novo for a few years now and it's perfect for my small business. I can deposit checks on the go, and integrate with all my payment processing apps. It's great to know that my ATM fees will be refunded, especially when traveling internationally.\n",
            " - I love how simple, easy and helpful Novo has been for my business banking. Recently they implemented a feature which allows me to automatically allocate a percentage of my revenue to a reserve account. I really appreciate this new option because it's one less step that I have to do manually.\n",
            " - Very easy to deal with. Called the customer department on few occasions and the issues were resolved quickly. Definitely recommend.\n",
            " - I would not recommend Novo as a business checking account. Because Novo is a front for a bank it lacks functionality that other banks have. It takes longer to move money. There are fees for things that other banks do not charge. Overall, we've had too many problems with the company to recommend it to others. While the biggest banks like Chase are terrible options for small businesses, in our experience, this particular option is not a good alternative. Looking for a new option to switch.\n",
            " - I've been a proud member of the Novo community, and I must say my banking experience has been nothing short of exceptional. The user-friendly interface, coupled with efficient services, has truly set Novo apart.From hassle-free account management to swift and secure transactions, Novo has proven to be a reliable banking partner. The 5-star rating is well-deserved, reflecting the seamless integration of modern technology with personalized financial solutions.Kudos to the Novo team for their commitment to customer satisfaction. I'm more than happy to spread the word about this fantastic banking experience!\n",
            " - Novo has been a revolutionary partner for my growing consultancy business. Navigating the intricate world of traditional banking was always challenging, but Novo has transformed that experience into something seamless and intuitive.From the moment I set up my account with Novo, I’ve been impressed with their streamlined processes and user-centric approach. Their platform is not only user-friendly but also incredibly efficient, making financial management almost effortless.The customer support at Novo deserves special mention; they’re consistently responsive, knowledgeable, and genuinely helpful, making every interaction a positive experience.It’s been over a year since I started using Novo, and the thought of going back to conventional banking is unimaginable. Novo hasn’t just simplified managing my finances; it has liberated me to concentrate on expanding my business, knowing that the financial side is in capable hands.A heartfelt thank you to Novo for being more than just a banking service; you are a true asset to businesses looking to thrive without the burden of financial complexities.”\n",
            " - Novo has been great - couldn't be easier to use, including for international payments.  Dashboard and all functions are smooth, I'm really a fan.  Good job!\n",
            " - Novo is always innovating. I love their invoice module and the ease with which we can schedule and revise invoices\n",
            " - No fees and and a powerful app!\n",
            " - I’ve been using Novo for almost a year now and I like it. With my small publishing business, I can use the reserve categories to set money aside for special projects. The app is connected to everything I need, the card works great. I woul love it if Novo offered a range of CDs so businesses owners can keep their savings from depreciating. I had to get a CD outside of Novo, but if they offered one, I would have used the service to avoid the money shuffling that had to happen. Other than that it’s a good financial product.\n",
            " - User friendly free business checking, easy to invoice & transfer. Only complaint is that I've had trouble with verification when using third party services like Plaid.\n",
            " - Novo makes banking easy with its app and online features. I feel like my information is greatly protected.\n",
            " - Novo made it easy to get my business up and running fast! I needed a bank account for a small business that I started to help me supplement my income during COVID. I got my DBA, set up my Novo account, then connected my Square, PayPal, Venmo, and Cashapp accounts to it. Made things super simple to get paid. The \"reserves\" feature helped me set aside tax money, too. Exactly what I needed, when I needed it!\n",
            " - I LOVE THE COMPANY THIS IS A GREAT COMPANY , BE PART OF THEIR PROGRAMS\n",
            " - My distain for learning new technology is real, so when I got the news that Brex, my former small business bank, was no longer supporting clients like me, I was skeptical I'd find a replacement I liked...and I was wrong! Not only was Novo easy to learn, it has FAR surpassed my already-high expectations!\n",
            " - I have used novo for at least 2 maybe 3 years now, and my experience has been entirely positive. Their fraud protection works nicely and doesn't get in my way that often too, which was a serious issue with my last institution. My only complaint is there is no way to integrate my custom finance software into their system, and no easy download which contains all of the transaction data, only a very basic about and title csv download. There is no office to visit, but this is expected as they are an online only institution.\n",
            " - Pretty decent banking however I don’t like the fact that I can’t write my own checks.. other than no issues…\n",
            " - I have been using Novo for nearly a year now, and as someone who has never had a business bank account before, the experience has been remarkably seamless. I have encountered no issues whatsoever with Novo. Their commitment to security is impeccable, and they even provide reimbursement for ATM withdrawals. I wholeheartedly recommend Novo to all my fellow business professionals.\n",
            " - Excellent for small businesses and free, really free.  Great for invoicing and all kinds of things.  The only issue, and for me it's not a big issue, is a zelle-type feature.  It takes too long to send money.\n",
            " - Just like a walk in bank. I love all the perks novo offers\n",
            " - The UX is fantastic. The onboarding experience to open an account is wonderfully simple. The in app support is responsive and helpful. 10/10\n",
            " - I was surprised by all the different gadgets inside the Novo site. Is the best internet Bank that serve the small business. I am so impressed.\n",
            " - The NOVO bank app features and services are amazing. Easy to setup a business account and generate invoices for vendors.\n",
            " - Amazing online banking for small biz.Been using Novo since 2021 when I first got accepted into the new company and it's good to know that the founder went to my college. Thanks Novo!\n",
            " - They make for a great bank to accept payments for my web based business.  No hassle, easy setup, virtually zero fees.  It's been a flawless experience so far.\n",
            " - I’m Very Satisfied with Discovering Novo Bank! I been with Novo over 3 years and the App works wonderfully and the Service is Great! SophanStyle\n",
            " - I was leery at first about signing up for Novo, but have been a customer for about two years and have been met with nothing but satisfaction. They are constantly taking in feedback and actively listening to customers for ways to improve, they add new integrations, and it’s a no nonsense kind of experience. Really easy features to keep control of your money.\n",
            " - They are great but they are new so they are strict on a lot of things with little flexibility\n",
            " - Novo has been a fairly hassle-free way to manage my business income. It's just me trying to do the day-to-day grind and Novo is simple but provides all the things I need.\n",
            " - Novo is user friendly and constantly improving.  Saves me lots of timing banking.\n",
            " - Started an account in February 2021 for my LLC.  Everything has worked perfectly and Novo's constant development demonstrates a commitment to SMBs!\n",
            " - I would've gave 5 stars if there were  way to deposit cash ! Other than that Novo is great\n",
            " - Such a wonderful bank!! So glad I found them!!\n",
            " - The absolute best and most well thought out mobile banking experience I have ever used. The Novo service is fast and easy to navigate. It has all the features you’d expect and can even connect to Ecom platforms for seamless integration. You are issued a physical card as well as a virtual card for your mobile wallet. They even have the availability for funding through their credit program. I love their feature of being able to a lot funds under multiple categories to keep things organized. There are no hidden or minimum account fees, gimmicks or games, what you see is what you get and it just works. Their customer services also fabulous and can be accessed within the app via chat. It really is a revolutionary service when it comes to banking. I highly recommend Novo Bank and their services. 10 stars!!!\n",
            " - Your team responded quickly to my question! Novo is a great online banking system I appreciate your continuous improvements to the website.\n",
            " - Have only been banking with them for about 4 months but they are far beyond a pleasure to work with.  Easily able to maneuver around the site and linking different apps including payroll has been a breeze.  Would recommend for all.\n",
            " - It works how I expected it too. Also little by little it keeps adding features that I see being handy in the near future\n",
            " - Very simple company to use for my small business. I’ve never had a problem receiving payments or processing payments.\n",
            " - What a fantastic experience I’ve with Novo! I can’t simply recommend enough. Everything is smooth and online request are resolved with in hours!\n",
            " - You can get almost everything done on their website. For the few times you may need help from a live person, they are very responsive on the app.  Very modern/digital first - for example, they have virtual debit card that you can use to make online purchases, no need to carry another physical card with you. Their best feature is out of the box integrations they provide with several services including accounting, invoicing etc., For a small business, one can automate most tings financial and worry about lot of other things they need to.\n",
            " - I switched from Alzo to Novo about 18 months ago and couldn’t be happier with my experience. The design is clean, the accounts and integrations are easy to set up and use. Novo’s help documentation rivals other great tech companies and honestly it doesn’t even feel like bank SaaS. They’ve knocked it out of the park with every iteration they’ve released. I recommend them over any “big bank” to every business owner I know.\n",
            " - Amazing banking experience,It is very clean and clear, also moving money is easy.\n",
            " - Reliable and trustworthy\n",
            " - I never have any issues or concerns. The company always doing it best to serve me. Thank you\n",
            " - I normally don't give reviews when it is requested if me. However, I owe Novo that much. Been with Novo since their inception. No fees, no fine print swindling, no issues whatsoever. It has been great to see Novo grow as it helps my business grow alongside it. Thank you Novo Team.\n",
            " - It's simple it just works. Online banking with a solid app. Plus free. More people need to know about Novo!\n",
            " - Depositing checks is as simple as taking a picture and uploading.  I am able to transfer money in and out of my accounts, including Venmo.  I can use any atm and the fees are reimbursed monthly.  This is my favorite account to use.\n",
            " - I enjoy the convenience and control.\n",
            " - Simple, easy, works every time, fast transaction processing times, and pretty much free.  Everything I need from a transaction-driven small biz bank.\n",
            " - I’m beginning a small business and Novo was the ONLY financial entity that gave me what I needed. Online, low fees, great app access and the ability to link with other money apps and bill clients. It has been flawless.\n",
            " - Novo is a great starter business bank. They have come a long way offering multiple options to meet your needs, invoicing system, transfers between accounts, and they have a new loan option that helps in the time of need for businesses that qualify.

            " - My business is very small and I’m struggling to get it off the ground. Novo has been a dream because they don’t charge you for long bouts of inactivity or for having a small amount in the account. They have a ton of very helpful tools that will be super helpful when my business really starts going! Every time I have had a question they have quickly answered!\n",
            " - Novo is fantastic in so many ways. The first of which is they very obviously put their customers first. A rarity in the banking world. Lots of features and cool integrations too\n",

            " - The platform is great whether on mobile or the website.  I have plugged it into Quickbooks and that works well.  The line of credit funding is a nice option that I am thinking of using.  I have sent checks to people.  That works well, but is pretty slow to process.  I didn't rate it a 5 star because I wanted to open another account, but Novo wouldn't let me.\n",
            " - I was a victim of a fraudulent charge. It did match any of my purchase history and was with a know scam store. They \"investigated\" my claim and said I authorized the charge. I will never use NOVO again and I recommend against it.\n",

            " - Haven’t had an issue with Novo. I was a little skeptical of a bank without walls, but since I rarely go to my bank with walls anyways, thought I’d take a chance. Really like it so far.\n",
            " - I never have any problems or have had my account hacked. Plus there are plenty of benefits that come along with it.\n",

            " - I’m in the infant stages of building my business, so I’m not making any money right now. Having Novo takes the pressure off of minimum balance amounts and monthly deposit requirements. There aren’t any fees and I can comfortably build my business so that I can eventually be ready to earn income.\n",
            " - Great Platform, although sometimes transfer get reversed by the physical bank when transferring from personal bank to Novo. Works great when transferring from physical bank's business account to NOVO's business accountGreat integrations, looking forward to new developments.\n",
            " - This company is growing consistently, and it has been an awesome experience being a part of it and watching them grow. I have had the opportunity to interact with several different employees of theirs and each one of them allowed me to leave said interaction with a smile, and feeling as if my concerns were both valid, heard, and also- RESOLVED! HAHA. I've always had a quick and speedy resolution on the few instances that something had gone wrong- whomever was at fault haha They have always made sure to go above and beyond simply resolving the issue. They're not quite \"perfect\" in terms of the perks they offer, and the stuff they don't yet provide: but they offer a ridiculous number of perks that totally make up for anything lacking!!!I rate it 5 stars, and highly recommend!!!\n",
            " - With all the issues people are having with Banking. We have not one. I love this platform. Novo makes running our non profit easy!\n",

            " - Everything just works! So many websites lock up...or have broken links... Not NOVO.  Ive been with them for a few years now and wish i had found them sooner.  also i have no problem accessing from overseas...  Vietnam, China, India, Singapore, Japan, All OK. that is NOT true for all banking web sites.\n",
            " - Novo's got a fantastic support team and a fun, clean app UX. Love have a business checking account with no monthly fees and Reserves to help divvy up income in sub-accounts.\n",
            " - I have been banking with Novo for 2.5 years and the convenience has me hooked!\n",
            " - It works.  Never had any money stolen. Yet.\n",
            " - No fees, was able to open account 100% online, and the reserves feature is a game changer.\n",
            " - I have been using Novo bank for several years. Low cost business banking. I have also used it to withdraw cash outside of the US, a little hit or miss, so carry a back up, but if it does allow you to withdraw cash there are no atm fees. Online bill payment is available, but send check payments out a couple of weeks in advance.\n",
            " - BasedConsulting.co has been using Novo for nearly 11 months and it has been working flawlessly. Creating invoices, budgets, and keeping an eye on expenses is all built in. It also easily syncs with common webapps. Great bank & tools!\n",

            " - I have had a really positive experience using Novo for almost a year now. I love their integrations. And their system to automatically distribute incoming funds into different buckets is very helpful!I wish they had a savings account that I could attach, but that is my only complaint.\n",
            " - Overall good for a starter business bank. They offer invoice option but is not truly an invoice more so you share your acct number and routing!!!!! For the clients to send you money. So I continue to have to use external options for payment. If they could get the invoice fixed I would give it a better rating.Business name Intentional VA\n",
            " - I love using Novo\n",
            " - I love being able to sort money into reserves, it’s super helpful as a self employed person to make sure I can separate out tax money.  It’s also been easy to set up invoices and transfer funds.\n",
            " - Really not great and now they’re begging for five star reviews?\n",
            " - The bank & its website/app is reliable.  You know what you are getting up front.  It includes free banking and ACHs.  I can use quicken to update the bookkeeping.\n",
            " - I’m a fairly new user to Novo and I must say I’m truly enjoying the experience so far.

            " - There is easy to work with, and provide all the benefits and tools that my business needs to successfully run my business.\n",
            " - Best banking products for a small business. Well organized financial software that makes it easy to track expenses and income. No unexpected expenses or overdraft feez.\n",
            " - I found Novo during the 2020 shutdowns. My local bank was ridiculously difficult to get into and felt unapproachable. I had to have a business account for clients to send money. Several years later and I wouldn’t use any other bank. Novo is responsive, has hands on helped with business loans, enabled me to scale my business and add a 2nd one. I wouldn’t put my company’s banking in any other hands than Novo.\n",
            " - I’ve been using Novo since 2018 and I love this business banking company. I like how easy it connects to stripe and other pay out apps. I like the built in apps where I can send an invoice. I love the different ways I can group money in the app and save up for certain things.\n",
            " - I've used Novo for my business banking for over 1 and a half now. Easy to use app and online banking with many affiliated products and entities. Free atms are also a bonus. BrainStorm Tees will remain using Novo as a long term customer.\n",
            " - Consistent platform access, improvements regularly,  ease of use and safe l.\n",
            " - Quicker deposits/ transfer times and I’ll change to 5 stars.\n",
            " - Novo has been a true game changer for the nature of my business – on the road most of the year. To have a business banking solution as fully distributed as the day-to-day is for my company removes the stress and worry about being able to handle every part of the accounting process from anywhere in the world, one day to the next. Every feature is built so reliably I never have to worry that transactions will meet a hiccup.\n",
            " - The account was simple to establish, link to my banking structure; and easily messes with my financial needs.You can't go wrong with NOVO.\n",
            " - Has been always consistent with their policies and practices. If something is wrong and its their responsibility, they handle it with integrity. If it was my fault then it was my oops. Small business consistency with no fees.\n",
            " - Novo takes the pain out of being a startup. Keeping Business separate from personal finances is the first rule of order and Novo makes it easy to get started.\n",
            " - Novo is all Go. Trust.\n",
            " - It’s been almost a year, since I’ve started my company an Novo has been very useful and accesible. The app is great and the integrations are very useful. Happy customer over here.\n",
            " - Novo is not your ordinary community bank! Unlike some other banks and credit unions we had experience with, they never once tried to hit us with any unexpected fees or charges.\n",
            " - Novo makes online banking simple, secure, cost-effective, and efficient.\n",
            " - Have a small business. Easy bank to work with. worked with them for 4 yrs. Cant write hand checks but they can issue checks with the app. A bit of a learning curve. But its actually more convenient. would recommend.\n",
            " - After startup I connected the business banking with my employee payroll for United Services Southern Corporation the establishment of the business banking for payroll account transitioned well with PayChex payroll firm.\n",
            " - Everything works for Novo.  Check deposits, ACH transfers, transactions get recorded efficiently.  It pretty much just works.  BofA, Wells, Chase, US Bank, all cannot meet the business banking service levels of Novo.\n",
            " - Everything I need in a bank…and nothing that I don’t.Give them a look.  Probably works best for most people.\n",
            " - No frills attached Business checking account. It has all the features that i was looking for\n",
            " - Customer focused, accessible, friendly and helpful staff\n",
            " - I’d love to give NOVO five stars. And as far as I’m concerned their customer service gets it. But the app/ platform itself hasn’t been as seamless for me as I’d like it to be. I have very few customers and one has had an issue with invoices being sent “overdue” the first day they’re issued. The other isn’t getting them at all. Both of these are reoccurring invoices that should be working fine and every so often have issues. If I was a larger company with even 10 clients I don’t feel I could depend on things to work as they should without needing these issues fixed. They’re always so quick to chat and help. But I feel like the platform itself can use some improvement.\n",
            " - I appreciate Novo.  It is a wonderful online portal, easy to use and navigate.  I highly recommend Novo for your business banking needs.My only suggestion for improvement would be to expand the invoicing capabilities to accept more than one payment to an invoice.  By allowing multiple partial payments with a 'received' receipt and a remaining balance calculation it would eliminate the need for me to manage that part.\n",
            " - Novo make online banking a seamless process. There system is very user friendly. I can't say enough about the different software systems that are available through Novo, invoices is my favorite and has made doing business so easy. The help desk team is phenomenal.\n",
            " - Awesome bank!\n",
            " - I appreciate the fact it is an online bank that provides the services that I need. The $0 monthly fee is great.  I have been using NOVO for almost 4 years, and haven't experienced any problems.\n",
            " - Uses customer feedback to make it's banking product better and better.\n",
            " - I’ve been banking with Novo for one year,And I’ve been really happy\n",
            " - Novo has been my first and only business bank. Their transparent fee structure, automation optimized platform, and simple to use website and app will keep me a customer. If you're looking for the simplest but still powerful business bank... look no further. I'm a customer for life.\n",
            " - I’m not a fan of big institutionalized banks, they are very behind in terms of modern functionality when it comes to financial planning. It doesn’t make sense to have all these third party planning tools when it can be built right in. Novo has proven that they’re willing to do that. I’m in love with their sub account features and the newly added automation that was put in place for that. Banks need to be more tech than ever these days and Novo is on the forefront of it. Thank you Novo! They’re team has been super helpful and has changed things simply based off my feedback to them and that’s what makes me feel confident in banking with them.\n",
            " - Novo has been an excellent online bank, helpful and friendly support agents help make the experience even better!\n",
            " - Love Novo! I've been with them about two years.\n",
            " - The very best online business bank.Lots of valuable features, especially for our eCommerce business and consulting work\n",
            " - Love Novo! Timely response in issues and everything works smoothly. User friendly platform that is clean and simple. Could not be happier!\n",
            " - Novo has been a great help for me! My only complaint would be that Novo hasn't incorporated Zelle. I have  quite a few customers that request to pay by Zelle. It would be great if it was an option in the future.\n",
            " - I have been using Novo for over a year after a bad experience with Wells Fargo. They have worked pretty well.\n",
            " - I'm very happy with Novo. The only reason I haven't migrated all of my accounts is I'm waiting for Novo to add more services that I require. I'm sure they will get there soon!!\n",
            " - I've been with Novo for a couple of years when I decided I needed to move from the BIG Business bank! It was the right move to make. The amount of features included in the app make it extremely useful to run the business!\n",
            " - I'm extremely disappointed with Novo’s handling of a significant fraud incident involving my small business, Hex Fly Co. Despite promptly reporting the issue, calling the fraud line, and requesting a stop ACH, Novo failed to refund the $20,000 stolen by hackers. The lack of resolution and support in such a critical situation reflects poorly on their commitment to customer security and satisfaction.\n",
            " - By far the easiest way to set up your business banking account.  If you need to set this stuff up on your own, you need to do it with Novo.  I can send invoices, I can manage the books, I get a card to use when I am out and about.  And it costs me nothing.\n",
            " - Novo helped me become better at money management.\n",
            " - Provide everything I need for my business without charging me through the roof!\n",
            " - They are simple and effective with tools that I need\n",
            " - Very convenient. Communication is always excellent. I have never had an issue.\n",
            " - Being able to easily link outside accounts, send invoices, and create and transfer different reserve funds are some of the features I appreciate from my Novo account.\n",
            " - Novo is great for not having fees. However if you need immediate cash your limited to daily limits on withdrawals and no local banks to assist you. I've been very disappointed with Novo when it comes to the challenges on fraud. My card was incorrectly charged by an unknown merchant total was $450. It took Novo a year to followup and say that they use a 3rd party to rescearch this fraud. Ending result was no credit for the fraudulent charge.\n",
            " - Little to no fees with Novo’s online business checking account, which has no monthly fees, ACH transfer fees, incoming wire fees or stop payment fees. I pay my employees or contractors with unlimited online invoicing, they usually receive the payment with 1 business day.\n",
            " - I enjoy the functionality and features of the app format. I am considering leaving because I need two accounts at the same bank which Novo does not currently support.\n",
            " - My experience with Banco Novo has been positive, highlighting the intuitive interface and efficient support. However, the absence of a Corporate Credit Card and the need for improvements to automatic transfers, such as Zelle, are areas that could be improved to offer a more complete and efficient experience. I'm looking forward to possible improvements to these features.\n",
            " - NOVO has been an amazing partner in the consultation business that I have.They have made invoicing and payments very easy, and their support staff has been very helpful.\n",
            " - The Novo experience has been fantastic from the start. I was worried about not having someone to call if we had an issue but their chat service is thorough and responsive. Would highly recommend them to anyone.\n",
            " - I think Mercury is a much stronger option.\n",
            " - I love Novo! I have used them now for a couple years for Business and I couldnt be happier! They watch things closely and if there is any problems they are quick to help. Honestly, I think I have only had a couple fraud alerts, have to OK it in the app and card is good to go again.\n",
            " - No nonsense and has great integrations for invoicing, cash payments, budgeting, etc.  I always send a referral to clients who are starting their small business.\n",
            " - Love Novo. I love that every transaction is immediately reflected, the line of credit option is awesome, and the automated reserves is so helpful.\n",
            " - These guys are an amazing, useful, simple online bank that get work done. Everything from beginning to end have been seamless. I will be using novo for all future biz banking accounts.\n",
            " - In a world run by greedy big banks charging for every little thing that small businesses can hardly afford, Novo is a breath of fresh air. - Free service- Fast payouts- Invoicing — particularly handy for gig-workers who do not have bookkeepers and/or accounting software\n",
            " - This is my first business bank and it has been amazing journey. I also enjoy the exclusive offers Novi offers for members. As well as a chance to receive compensation for people we refer.Set your account up today.\n",

            " - Novo has been a great banking experience. I love the ease of the app and how I can set up multiple categories to send $ to!\n",
            " - Fantastic Experience.  Been using Novo for several years, and literally the most ease-filled and pleasant online banking experience one could wish for,\n",
            " - It’s just a great bank from the ease of setting it up to using it online.  There are no fees, sending and receiving money is easy as well.\n",
            " - It’s very hard to get anything done quickly!\n",
            " - I first chose Novo because it was a virtual bank with which I could create a business account. I didn't have time to walk into a local branch to set up an account somewhere else. Secondly, they didn't have a minimum balance requirement, which is handy for startups. The monthly allotment of transfers, deposits, etc. is plenty for me starting out. I even used its invoice feature before getting another program for invoicing.\n",
            " - Novo is a fantastic financial institution for small businesses. Everything is so simple and straightforward. Great added value with invoicing, connection to Stripe, and partner discounts.\n",
            " - Easy to do business using the app. I can automate invoices, and Support is quick to respond to my queries.\n",

            " - Works good for me in my business. Smooth transactions no running back was forward to the bank and trustworthy.\n",
            " - Very much like working with NOVO bank. They have a very easy way to access - conveniently clean website to manage your account. And the thing I like the most is how you can, just like quickbooks, attach each revenue and expense to a specific folder so each is authomaticaly going to the right place at the end of the year and you have a better visibility of all statement.The thing NOVO does not have at this time and I would say its important nowadays: Zelle.This is so appreciated. Even though I sometimes prefer not having so I end up spending less. (LOL)Thank you!\n",
            " - Thank You for caring enough to kindly consistently,  reach out to me to assist me with making an update... With life being so busy I would have forgotten\n",
            " - Everything is clear and easy and no confusion or issues ever. 100% satisfied after six months.\n",

            " - I've been using Novo for over 2 years and I've had zero issues with the platform. Everything just works as it should.

            " - Novo is simple, clean, and reliable. I moved my business banking to Novo because I could NOT find a local bank whose dashboard was user friendly. It's like they barely even consider the UI. Seriously, what do you want from a bank's website? Novo gives you that - in spades. Then, because the website is so intuitive, they're services are also easy to use. I just connected a Tumblr to Stripe to Novo without a hitch.\n",
            " - Novo is a great bank with amazing customer service. They worked with us as a brand new business and as we grew they made it easy enough to increase all of our limits to make transfers convenient and free.

            " - I love Novo! I see private practice clients part-time and they pay cash, and I am not an organized person, so the fact that you can tell Novo to take a percentage of each deposit and put it in a separate reserve for things like taxes or owner compensation is a game changer!\n",

            " - I have been banking with NOVO for about six months. I love and hate their \"reserves\" feature. Love it because it helps me budget and dictate where funds should go for each part of my business, and hate it because it also illuminates the flaws in my business.Overall, I am happy with Novo. Their site is easy to navigate, they integrate with payment apps really well, and they seem to regularly update their website to make navigation and use more streamlined.\n",
            " - Their flexibility , reliability and respect for the working professional has made the experience worth the investment of time . If the business is a startup or already in operation , you can not go wrong with these folks .\n",

            " - The simplicity of the app.1 thing that should change is the duration of loan. 6 months is a tad short\n",
            " - It is a very good business bank. I am starting because it has all the tools for billing, and it allows my clients to pay with credit or debit cards, Paypal, check or transfer. The bank is very complete, the only thing it lacks for it to be be perfect is the transfers by Zelle\n",
            " - If you’re a new business looking for your first banking accounts, novo is not a bad choice but their transparencies are not 100% visible. Once the honeymoon phase is over (first three months ish), Novo demonstrated poor business ethics and often seemed illegal. On several occasions they blamed network issues for delayed transactions to be cleared. I’ve had over 1000 instant transfers from PayPal or Venmo, never has an instant transfer needed to take 8 days. Pending transactions with companies like Uber have always been retuned within a day or at most two. Not fourteen. novo’s escuses never made sense, their support are bots or just bad copy and pasters. You also have to basically do their work. Their dashboard is hard to follow as they lay things out with by vendor not transaction. Was it a good foot in the door? Yes. But there’s notEven a phone number to call. You have to go around corners and it’s just a lot of Bs.\n",
            " - Banking with Novo for 2 plus year and no issues at all. Banking made super easy that you'll assume all other banks offer the same services, but then realize that they don't. If other banks do offer the same services its often with fees or higher fees.\n",
            " - No fees, no hassles, just free banking!\n",
            " - Fantastic experience and integrates seamlessly with WAVE online accounting.\n",
            " - Not great B2B communication, restrictive internal network, & slow to respond. Messaging is not possible on the website, just the app, which must be connected to a phone number. Really bad for doing business with multiple members on an LLC. Aside from that, the payments do go through and their invoice tool is alright. Could be better when paying invoices, instead of doing separate payments (could be automatic based on past payment/invoice history).\n",
            " - Novo is very innovative and they cater directly to independent business owners like myself.\n",
            " - Novo supports new businessBeen very happy with my Novo service.\n",
            " - Always helpful, prompt and all you need to run your business is within the app\n",
            " - Seems like they try to improve all the time and still maintain free checking. Keep up the good work novo\n",
            " - Novo is easy to use, even as a senior, which I am. It is self-explanatory. I almost used another online bank for my new business but when there was a power surge the other site would not let me back in and basically accused me of fraud! I gave up trying to talk to a human. I have not had this problem with Novo. I have not talked to a human but their customer support responded quickly to my email when I had one issue. So far, so good. I do recommend!\n",
            " - The app is extremely user friendly. I’ve rarely experienced any bugs. Customer support is very communicative\n",
            " - I have no complaints! It is a wonderful company for a small business, and I appreciate the attentive customer service I receive.

            " - Seamless and efficient by design and execution. If you are looking for this kind of service and peace of mind, well I have found it here.\n",
            " - Very effective communication with customers.\n",
            " - No domestic wire transfer and recurring payments available. Once these are available you will get 5 stars.\n",
            " - Mobile deposits easy to do but in today's electronic world, take much too long to clear.\n",
            " - Great on line bank they don’t pummel you with text messages and unwanted emails. Quick and easy set up great for anyone on the go\n",
            " - Novo is a unique bank and it fits perfectly with my very unusual business.  The ease and simplicity of using Novo is something that other banks are trying to imitate.  I look at Novo as a innovative institution using the latest technology to help their customers achieve the most from their businesses.\n",

            " - Wow!! This bank has impressed me so much. It has been everything I need for my small business. Everything from Novo funding to easy stripe setup to send and track invoices to making payments. Thank You NOVO\n",
            " - Home Minister Narendra Modi launched y\n",
            " - I have had a Novo Account since 2021 for my business. I also have referred friends and family to Novo too! It is simple to set up and helps me to keep track of payroll, taxes expenses and much more. The reserve feature is my favorite feature. I can send invoice and receive payments quickly. It also allows you to link other payment apps too. I am also able to get any concerns or questions answered in a timely matter. The customer service has been stellar for me.\n",
            " - Love this bank! I will forever bank with Novo.\n",
            " - So much easier to work with as opposed to a conventional bank. A generous line of credit was extended without even asking or applying for it.\n",
            " - Could use some better UI/UX when it comes to looking at the financial analysis such as being able to look at lifetime earnings and last years. Otherwise I’ve loved banking with them since I started.\n",
            " - Love the reserve buckets. Absolutely game changing.\n",

            " - Love how I am not nickel and dimed like the big banks do. Also, they have great business loans for quick money when you need a little help.\n",
            " - Novo is very dependable. Easy to contact when you have a problem and solves your problems. Wouldn’t trust my business with any other bank. Novo is the best.\n",
            " - Love the convenience, innovative experience and app integration!!!!\n",
            " - I’ve been so impressed with novo and it’s helped me manage my cashflow even better than when I was updating my quickbooks 5 days a week.Truly innovative and small business friendly. I’ve suggested many people I know check them out.\n",
            " - Novo has been reliable from the start. I had another online business bank that just abruptly shut down. Everything with Novo has been smooth. I even discovered features I didn’t know I needed like invoicing. I don’t usually invoice customers, but a unique project came up, and I didn’t have to use a separate invoicing or payment system. Sent it from Novo, customer paid with ACH. I’m very grateful it was that simple.\n",
            " - I have been using Novo for more than a month now...i have not had any problem and the customer care is quite effective.\n",
            " - Best Online Business bank. Novo has met and exceeded all my expectations.\n",
            " - The most dependable online-only business bank. I've tried 3 others previously (started with Novo in 2020) and this is the one that is the most consistent and actually integrates customer feedback. The Reserves system is based off of Profit First which makes it SO helpful to budget and save without the hassle of switching money into different accounts. And their customer service has always been on par. Also the last time I spoke with someone there I asked if they were going to sell out to a bigger bank (which happened with multiple other online banks) and they said no their growth plan is provide more tools for small businesses rather than sell out to a big bank which is very comforting. Obviously I'm not holding them to it (you gotta do what you gotta do) but knowing that their plan is to continue to serve small businesses makes me trust them more.\n",
            " - Novo is a breeze to use, features like invoicing and 3rd party integration makes it the best for new business\n",
            " - The system is easy to understand and you get notifications when debits or credits hit your account.\n",
            " - Great service and the product has never failed us! Payments in and out are speedy and we have taken advantage of the line of credit offered as well. Very helpful features!\n",
            " - Too bad we can’t give 10 stars. The\n",
            " - I generally don't write reviews, but as a journalist, I feel it's important to address this. This fintech service is subpar. Transactions are far from instant, and my funds have been on hold for nearly three weeks with no resolution in sight. If you're willing to share your experience with their practices on record, please email us at team (at) culturemass.com.\n",
            " - Since being a member of Novo it has made running my business so much easier. It allows me to send invoices and receive payments, it looks professional and it is very easy to bank with Novo.\n",
            " - My Novo experience has been great. I am able to make deposits tp my account very efficient and with ease. In addition I have a cash advance feature tied to my account and I used it with ease as well. It was all done in real time which was gret.\n",
            " - I am a Novo customer for about 3 years, beside 2 other banks. Novo is the easiest and most reliable. Even for international payments, Novo has integrated Wyse, which is so convenient. Only good things to say about this bank.\n",
            " - Novo bank still has a lot to work on, I will never bank with them again due to their security not being top notch for a business bank. The customer service is never American people, and they never know the company policies or anything that ties to their jobs. The app doesn't show real time acc info as well , as it lags a 2-3 hour difference especially on weekends which is horrible.Their security has been breached multiple times, stay away from them!!\n",
            " - So as is the normal response is \"apologize and will look into this\"  you have been \"looking into this\" for 9 weeks.  $4,400 in fraudulent charges and not one alert from them.  Charges done in the UK???  that would be a flag?\n",
            " - Game changers when it comes to banking for business.\n",
            " - I have had Novo.co for almost a year now and the app provides all my small gig's business needs. I operate a small specialized tax preparation business and like the fact that I can make notes and the multiple drop-down selection options to code the various income and expenses I incur. This will save a lot of time during tax time as I will be able to bucket these on my Schedule C. Furthermore, I like the fact that it is connected to multiple payment apps (Square, Stripe, Cash app, PayPal). Lastly, I do like the referral code to earn $40, which compensates for not paying interest income (most banks don't and that is why it is free).On the negative (not in a bad way), I would say that it needs to provide interest income and needs to issue a business credit card instead of a debit card but so that our unused cash earns interest. However, see note above on referral bonus to make up for this. I maintain my 5 star rating.\n",
            " - This is the first time I can say I actually really like a bank. Novo keeps adding new features that are super useful (and most importantly - convenient) for my business\n",
            " - Well I’ve had them for about 1 year, I’ve got a very small business that’s my side hustle and they have been awesome, it’s great how I can organize my money in different reserves and I even applied for my first business loan, just shy of 2k but with time I’m sure I can get bigger loans as I build credit report. I love Novo\n",
            " - As a small business design agency owner with robust digital marketing capabilities, I understand the intricacies and challenges of setting the groundwork in such a dynamic industry. The journey can be daunting starting out, from building vital networks to discovering potential clients and managing employee payments. Enter Novo, and the landscape transformed!Their platform effortlessly bridges the gaps that most budding businesses, like mine, encounter. Invoicing clients used to be a chore, but it's streamlined and professional with Novo. As for payroll, I can now ensure my creative team gets compensated on time, every time. But what stands out most? Their commitment to growing alongside my business. As I chart a course towards expansion and greater digital influence, it's heartening to know that Novo will be there every step of the way, adapting and providing the tools I need.To all the entrepreneurial spirits in the design and digital marketing realm – if you're searching for a platform that resonates with your challenges and delivers real-time solutions, Novo is your answer.\n",
            " - Awesome team, great support and the apps I need to help run my business.\n",
            " - The only bank for my business! They've been great regarding international fees. I work remotely and need a flexible bank. All other big name banks (those with physical bank branches and offices) are eventually going away if they don't go digital.\n",
            " - Very satisfied with the products available and ease of use.\n",
            " - I would not recommend Novo as a suitable financial institution for small businesses or startups. Novo exhibits a stringent approach, particularly within the Business Loan division. Regrettably, my experience involved a minor delay in payments, which subsequently led to a series of complications. Although payments were initiated, credits were not accurately applied, resulting in the closure of my account a full fourteen days after the due date.In all fairness, I have encountered no issues with Novo's Banking services. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work with an account manager who displayed exceptional responsiveness and professionalism. However, it was within Novo's funding group that I encountered significant challenges.\n",
            " - I will start by saying banking with Novo has been different, given they don't have branches to walk into and yet rewarding because we have saved a ton of money on fees. I am not a fan of Novos phone customer support. They always seem to be very distant but the service itself is amazing.\n",
            " - Dumbest bank on the planet. All digital bank with goofy limits and permissions needed for making deposits. Impossible to run a business with irrational limits like this.\n",
            " - Great company who makes business easy.  It integrates with apps like Quickbooks and PayPal and countless other apps.  They even gave us a small line of credit which was very helpful in the beginning of our journey.\n",
            " - These trashbags are a terrible bank and since you want to close people's accounts with no clear explanation. The moment any bank receives your SSN or EIN they are all committing a crime under consumer law. #2 All banks are not the creditors, we the consumers actually are. #3 Everyone needs to file an arbitration against this bank if they screwed you. I'll expose all you fat cu*ts at Novo.\n",
            " - Very good mix of services for a small business. Really fits my growing needs. Give them a try. You won't regret it.\n",
            " - Enjoy being able to schedule out checks, as well as assign income into different categories by percentage.  Helps to prepare for taxes, upkeep, etc.\n",
            " - Excellent profit first business bank account! Has allowed all of my startups to evolve to the next level financially.\n",
            " - If you need help with questions they respond quickly, and you get to speak with a human.\n",
            " - I hate to leave it a 3 star. It would be a 5 star if they'd fix their previously-awesome app, which now notes deposits as both additions to the overall balance AND as subtractions from the balance when using sub-account/savings features. The result is a hot mess that keeps me from deciphering my overall available balance at any given time. I don't like operating blindly. This desperately needs a fix or I'm going to have to find a new provider.\n",
            " - They are the best. Easy to use. Loads of free services to assist. It’s a little hard to deposit cash, and cashing a check is not an option. But those are things I rarely ever do. So that is the trade off. Small price to pay.\n",
            " - The invoice process was so easy to execute! I was thrilled with the ease in which it was to create an invoice, send and receive payment.\n",
            " - They thought of EVERYTHING. From ability to separate Reserves, Real-Time LOC access, Online CC feature, I mean this account is the most Business Friendly Banking I've ever experienced. The only thing that would make it better would be for them to start paying interest to compete with other online business banking options.\n",
            " - I've been using Novo for a few years now and I love the ease and functionality of the desktop and mobile app. Furthermore, their no-fee policy makes them ideal for my business. My only dissatisfaction is that their customer service response time is slow. You cant just pick up the phone and call them to resolve an issue are get answers to questions.\n",
            " - We had over $1000 fraudulently stolen from our account and Novo has done nothing to make it right, as a small business who put our trust in Novo, we  have been crushed by this and hope you won't do the same.\n",
            " - Novo has been our primary business bank.  My colleagues and subcontractors have also chosen Novo, which has made invoicing and payments quick and easy.\n",
            " - Clean and simple process. No minimum balance is a plus\n",
            " - Novo has been a great partner.  The products and services continue to grow as our business grows.  Finally someone has our interest at heart.\n",
            " - Was skeptical at first but after 10 months of banking with NOVO I can attest to their legitimacy. They have in house opportunities for small businesses and are big about security. + they’re FDIC insured. 5 stars!\n",
            " - I love the awesome business account and associated app!\n",
            " - Not the best bank for issues that need to be resolved. Where's a number to call?I have a few clients that have not been able to connect with Quickbooks myself included for over a week now because of some weird update with Novo and me being a novo customer as well that referred them to novo...this is a little frustrating and doesn't make me look great on recommendations.\n",
            " - I'm in love with how the Reserves work in Novo.I just set the percentages and every deposit gets distributed to their own little \"bucket\", even though they are all in the same account.Now I don't spend more than a few minutes every couple of weeks on my banking so I can concentrate on the rest of my business.\n",
            " - Great Banking, awesome App, and integrations. Love the invoicing app.\n",
            " - I have used Novo since I became an independent contractor and have been happy with the service. The app and web interface are great and I have rarely had any trouble immediately doing what I want without support. I reached out to them once for a small question and they helped me right away.\n",
            " - People treating people like people.  Reminiscent of the days when I was young and loyalty counted, as well as kindness.  Quick response is great too!\n",
            " - The ease of the app and security is a great feature for my business.\n",
            " - Great experience, veryresponsive\n",
            " - Great system, really love the bank with them.  They gave us a bonus for trusting them, which made it even better!\n",
            " - I have been using the platform to manage my business finances, creates and send invoices and connect to other digital assets on the web. I love novo because I can manage my business finance better than I can with a traditional bank because of all the tools and integrations.\n",
            " - Novo makes my business life 100% manageable.  Bank with confidence!\n",
            " - Novo made starting my new business a breeze.  The integrations with Stripe, Paypal and my accounting software is priceless!  I've been a NOVO user for 2 years and it's the best\n",
            " - I love the segmenting!I'm able to dedicate certain percentages to taxes and other goals withing my business and everytime there is incoming money, I love that Novo automatically seperates it.\n",
            " - Excellent online banking with every tech option and integration you could want.\n",
            " - I have used Novo for a couple years. Good service, no real fees and the added benefits like free invoicing keep getting better.\n",
            " - I was provided with accurate and speedy responses.\n",
            " - I have been with NOVO for a few years now and I have no complaints.\n",
            " - Novo has been great for my small business. I'm still learning the ropes of what it means to run everything on my own, and I never have to worry about Novo. I feel professional and polished when I send invoices through the app. I love having everything in one place.\n",
            " - Novo easily is connected with all my Stripe transactions, which makes me love using Novo to manage my business.\n",
            " - I've had my business account with Novo Bank since the first day of 2020. Novo Bank has been doing a great job of ensuring their customers have access to as many features as possible by allowing us to integrate many features and apps to make the banking process hassle-free. To date, I have had zero issues with this bank.\n",
            " - Novo has all the features small, online businesses like me need.  Secure connections with online merchant services, mobile deposit, reserves, clear activity viewing, bill pay, and more.\n",
            " - I love the security and the record of my transactions  are online and easy to read. Making bank transfers are simple and fast. I like it a lot to when being notified through text message for security purposes.\n",
            " - Constant product improvment.  More services and quick and through responses to every issue I have had over the last 2+ years as a customer.\n",
            " - Take your business banking elsewhere before you’re sorry. Novo seemed like a great option as I started my small business. As my business and revenue began to grow I quickly noticed an issue with deposits being delayed (specifically larger deposits), and not to mention there is absolutely no way to reach customer service and speak to an actual human that deals with this so called “bank.” As our revenue grew Novo continued to place more so called “holds” on our hard earned deposits. We made the smart and quick decision to leave as fast as possible. Make sure you do the same before they take advantage of you and your hard earned business. Stay very far away.\n",
            " - Reliable. Communication is good. The money is available when expected.\n",
            " - I have had several completely online banks and always moved my account for various reasons. I've now been with novo for a couple of years and they've been just fantastic! Their support is very responsive and they have always help me out with my various banking situations\n",
            " - I have been banking here for 3yrs with no issues\n",
            " - We love Novo.Packed full of features, integrations, and all of the services we need.\n",
            " - Excellent customer relations and Novo's online banking platform integrates with other business tools (payments, invoicing, accounting, budgeting, payroll, and productivity) to help run your business.\n",
            " - The best bank only that is outer on market Helps small and started companies alike my ..\n",
            " - A great Bank for Businesses to stay organized and manage all funds accordingly.\n",
            " - Novo is on the apology tour again but I still haven’t received any assistance…\n",
            " - I am not a fan of banks. That being said you can't really do business without one. I have used all the major banks and have found them lacking. Novo has handled every bit of our banking needs and I love the Boost feature that gets me my money from card processors 2 days faster. 10 out of 10, would recommend.\n",
            " - For someone who is not tech savvy, I have been thrilled with how user friendly Novo is for a new small business owner from expense tracking to invoicing and connecting with Stripe.  I also love their reserves concept where when revenue comes in, it gets automatically separated into buckets for taxes, expenses and to make sure I always pay myself!\n",
            " - I love the notifications. They keep me on top of my game!\n",
            " - Novo the best bank there is ! The only thing they need is Zelle\n",
            " - The banking services with out exorbitant fees was a huge plus.\n",
            " - Probably the best banking app I have come across. Absolutely love every aspect of it.\n",
            " - This bank is a game changer! The reserves feature, novo boost, and pretty much all of the features make it far superior to any other bank I’ve used for my businesses\n",
            " - Great banking experience I really like this bank they are easy smooth and hassle free\n",
            " - great for independent artists no atm feescash checksbookeeping tracking and small business integrations great customer serviceawesome!\n",
            " - This company is set up to help the business owner as much as possible. They ask for client input from time to time. They try to offer as many services as possible.I love it!\n",
            " - Super easy to sign up, zero fees, pretty rapid support team.  Integrates with all the apps, quickbooks, etc.  I recommend to all my business owner partners.\n",
            " - Novo has been a great banking partner. When other banks said no, Novo said yes!\n",
            " - This is the easiest business bank to work with. There are no crazy fees, and it is easy to pay others. The best part is that I can set up reserves to stay on target for things like taxes and emergency funds. I also love the easy share link for NOVO referrals with others. And you get paid for sharing!!\n",
            " - Great App. However, issuing checks takes too long and I abandoned that feature.\n",
            " - I appreciate the level of care and support U receive fro the team.\n",
            " - Novo has made the impossible, possible.  They are an essential for small biz.  Even after I got in with a bigger bank I went BACK to Novo because they are better.\n",
            " - Novo has made everything really, really easy. They've made invoicing easy, and integrate with Stripe seemlessly (I actually had no prior experience with credit card processing and was able to create a Stripe account and get it associated with Novo very easily). I'm glad I chose them for my small business banking needs.\n",
            " - THANK YOU guys for being so easy to use! I came on accident because banks were closed and needed a fast solution online to get income that day. But I STAYED because of how good Novo is! Incredible.\n",
            " - Absolutely great experience!\n",
            " - I took a risk using this for my business bank account & I'm so happy I did! Novo has been incredibly helpful and I especially love using the \"reserves\" to dedicate certain funds to particular expenses.\n",
            " - Online Banking experience is top-notch. Free everything for business accounts. The support staff will respond the same day.  Novo Lending was effortless to get the funds needed to start a project.\n",
            " - easy to implement, I can do most things myself . Low bureaucracy\n",
            " - Fantastic tool for Small BusinessI love the ease of this platform and being able to see my square and stripe sales in one place!!! Centralization is key and the reserves feature is awesome\n",
            " - Banking made easy.  Can easily do multiple transactions at the touch of a button.\n",
            " - I was tired of just being a number with Chase bank and their fees. I wanted a new banking experience and relationship. I have a digital agency and Novo bank meets my needs. Thanks for the good work and service.\n",
            " - Used for years with multiple businesses and love it\n",
            " - Novo is great for small businesses like mine. They make it very easy to open the account and to manage my finances. They also have a instant cash advance funding option which I utilized when an urgent repair was required.The technical and customer support staff was quick to respond within 24 hours. I would have liked the quicker response but it was reasonable enough. Jake, the representative, broke down his response and made it very understandable and went above and beyond to be helpful.If there was one thing I would change, is to provide better and more robust reporting on finances and to integrate with other platforms a bit better. Nevertheless, it does have a integration with Wave accounting software which is also awesome.\n",
            " - Free banking accessible online with the ability to invoice and other useful things\n",
            " - Very professional user friendly platform!\n",
            " - Helping with a line of credit\n",
            " - It's so easy to handle all of business banking needs via the app including debit and credit cards. Quick deposits from online sales as well.\n",
            " - I enjoy NOVO a lot. They are the hassle-free online bank that I want for my business.\n",
            " - Novo has been great to work with.  Their Quickbooks integration works beautifully making it easy to automatically transmit state and federal tax payments when due and record transaction details within Quickbooks.\n",
            " - Excellence online bank! I love that they refund you the fees for using ATM.\n",
            " - novo has been a consistently good experience from user perspective.\n",
            " - I love banking with Novo Bank. They have implemented some changes over the past year that have been beneficial to me and my business. The reason I have not given them five stars is because they do not offer Zelle and because they said they were changing their Novo funding. I understand that changes happen and can be good, but the email that was sent was ambiguous and did not explain what the changes were going to be or when they would take place. More clarity is needed on these changes to help reduce stress and anxiety to your users.\n",
            " - It's okay...\n",
            " - These morons will delete your account for no reason due to their Khazarian Mafia/Freemason ties when you're on their watchlist. Just to let you know, I'll see you guys in court soon.\n",
            " - Really good supportProactive account managers, and smooth for my AR purposes.  I do not have much AP, but when I do it has also been smooth and tech integrated\n",
            " - so good, the best, i'd kiss novo if it was a person\n",
            " - Handsdown one of the best digital banks to date. Phenomenal structure and service. Love how they integrated \"Profit First\" concept into account reserves.\n",
            " - I own a automation company and every client of mine has positive feedback from using NOVO, I also bank with NOVO Business and I have to say its easy and its everything you need 5/5\n",
            " - Easy to open a business account. Straight forward mobile application and integrated apps\n",
            " - Great for Business banking and the quarterly calls to get feedback and check in are also a plus\n",
            " - Love this bank for the biz. One more month and I will have had my acct for a year, and I can start using my point that I have accumulated.\n",
            " - Take more risks. Give more loans\n",
            " - Novo is always fast and helpful.  They resolve issues and make using the platform easy.  They helped up fix a bank transfer initiated by our lender by mistake but cleared it up.  We appreciate everything they did to resolve the issue.\n",
            " - A trustworthy bank to handle my business that’s feel safe and secure.\n",
            " - Novo has been exactly what we wanted.We've had them for a year and a half, and it was the best banking decision.The only thing they need to be perfect is Zelle and to make check deposits available sooner than 4 business days.Also, they provided an unrequested line of credit, there are no fees and we've gotten $160 from them for referring other business owners.\n",
            " - Amazing ! Love everything about Novo!! The Best!!!\n",
            " - I've been with Novo since 2021. I've not made many transactions compared to the average business owner; however, referrals have earned me solid fees from Novo and I've not experienced any issues in the past two years. All good. I recommend.\n",
            " - Novo has proven to be an essential tool for our small and growing business.  They have gone above and beyond what a bank normally does.  Thank you for your service Novo team, couldn't have done it without you.\n",
            " - I tried several other business banking \"brands\" but Novo was straight forward since day one.Amazing support, just exactly what my company needs, and a bit more.\n",
            " - I am really enjoying Novo as my small business banking resource. I love the account reserves feature and I can have funds go automatically to the reserve accounts I want. Operating Expenses, Owner Compensation, Profits, Taxes, Savings. I enjoy the other tools like Invoices, this really helps with getting my funds directly into my account quicker and avoiding additional processing fees. Every little bit helps.\n",
            " - Novo is great! I’ve used them for my business for over a year and couldn’t be happier. Checking, Debit Cards, Lines of Credit, they really have everything I need in a bank to run my company! Thanks Novo! - James, The Web Lifestyle LLC.\n",
            " - Novo is hands down the best banking experience for start-ups and small businesses. Signing up is easy and fast, the integrations with 3rd software are the best, and customer service is awesomely responsive. Best of all, they regularly add extremely useful new features. I've been a member for a few years and have referred many collegues who are just as happy with their experience as I am. If you are considering leaving the big banks, who don't care about you, try Novo, you won't be disappointed.\n",
            " - Novo has been great for the couple of years I've been using them! I use Novo to do all the banking for my small company, and their app made it really easy to send and manage invoices and process paychecks from my clients. I've only had to contact customer support a couple of times, and they've always been friendly and resolved the issue quickly.\n",
            " - NOVO has been excellent. I have two business accounts with them, and have no complaints. They update me every step when I receive funds or there are outgoing funds, so never a surprise! I highly recommend them.\n",
            " - I love this company.  I was a little apprehensive about trusting a company I never heard of but they had great reviews.  I have been with them now for 2 years as I grow my company and I have not encountered any issues.\n",
            " - Novo has been an amazing business bank. They have a wonderful app. Offers integration with stripe. No fees for ATMs and some novo funding to help fund your company in between client checks.\n",
            " - The communication is stellar and the support is top notch.Thank you Novo\n",
            " - I wish all my banks were like this. The automation features are excellent!\n",
            " - Novo has been one of the best online bank experiences I’ve had in a while. Novo boost is so helpful and the tools that you can integrate to your bank makes everything so much smoother!  Glad I made the switch.\n",
            " - I needed to have a business account fast..went to a local bank who had all these paperwork they wantef me to fill and bring on a different day because \"the account person\" wasn't in. Since I was in a hurry, and being that it was 2022, I decided there had to be an easier way...checked online and found NOVO and the whole process was so easy and convenient without having to jump through hoops nor talk to anyone. It's been 1.5 years now and still extremely happy with how seamless my banking is.\n",
            " - Simply the best. Everything you need. Nothing you don’t. And totally free. What’s not to love?\n",
            " - We were tired of working with the big chains bank and found novo no we are moving all of our business over to Novo banking solutions.we love how you can split all the accounts up to be able to better manage them.\n",
            " - So far, my experience has been positive. I've been able to invoice, pay and transfer money without any issues. There are limitations with what I am able to put on my invoices, and customization is sometimes tricky. However, I've been able to adapt and move forward.\n",
            " - Banking is a breeze and fast. For new businesses needed banking immediately Novo will get you up and running literally in minutes.  Fast processing and ease of use. Thank you guys for such a well built platform\n",
            " - Decent online bank. I like using them for my small business. Being able to send invoices right from the app is definitely the most helpful feature. This keeps my accounting efforts to the minimum.The only drawback is that not all the merchants can charge my bank card, including my local state departments. So I have to use PayPal for some transactions. Hopefully Novo can fix it one day.\n",
            " - I am so proud of NOVO and their dedication to small businesses, they consistently adding new opportunities for businesses to thrive! ❤️❤️\n",
            " - Everything you need from a bank and more. Right at your fingertips. 6 years of 5 star service for me #FLIEBOS\n",
            " - They are by far the best bank I've ever dealt with. Incredibly fast. Their support is so helpful and quick to respond. They will work with you to fit their systems to exactly what you need. You need to deposit a big check digitally? easy. You need to pay a contractor? Instant. It's amazing. They're amazing.\n",
            " - I love Novo! Have 3 accounts with them!\n",
            " - They are consitantly improving their platform.\n",
            " - My favorite business bank. Their reserves where you can set up a certain percentage to go into your reserves to pay yourself or for reinvestment in your business are a huge time saver.\n",
            " - They started off great.... Was very impressed with both the quality of service and the ease of use. After about 2 years,  their standards have decreased, customer service reps dont understand what you are asking them and give you wrong info, can't make deposits over a certain amount, can't make purchases over a certain amount, ACH transfers that claim to be same day happen the next day, automated replies approving items such as temporary increases are false.... To be quite frank, a bit more and I'm taking my business banking else where..very very disappointing.\n",
            " - I’m having a great time working with you. You are doing a great job\n",
            " - The ease of check deposit I feel is the best.Will be a year next month and very happy\n",
            " - I find it very easy to navigate and has all the practical options I need. I also value that I didnt need a minimum deposit or monthly balance to open the account.\n",
            " - Overall a good experience. Novo does not allow any type of paper checks which is a drawback.  No ability to wire transfers.  They hold deposited checks for several days before clearing and impose restrictive limits on transfers.  For a very small business, they are great.  Mid-size and up the limits can be hobbling and create unnecessary stress to find alternative payment methods\n",
            " - Reliable trustworthy Bank.\n",
            " - Prompt. Professional. Helpful.\n",
            " - As a freelancer on the go, I really like the ease of invoicing, well, on the go. Also, being able to easily remind customers payment is overdue has resulted in clients quickly getting up-to-date with their payables--my receivables.\n",
            " - Received my information fast and in a friendly manor.\n",
            " - Refused to accommodate a $3000 increase in my business line of credit. This is following a 20minute call with one of their banking personnel. I explained my business revenue and provided all the required details. Noting revenue exceeding $15000/month. Yet they only provide me with a $3800 business line of credit.\n",
            " - I love working with Novo. I moved all of my business accounts to their bank and do not miss the fees I was paying with a larger well known bank that I’d been with for 20 years +. Their customer service/support is top notch, quick and they love to follow upto make sure I’m good!\n",
            " - Novo has done nothing but impress me since I started my business. They are constantly asking for feedback and provide actually useful new features on a regular basis. The Reserve system they implemented last year has been a life saver for this ADHD business owner. I don't have to think about putting money aside from my income, you can set a percentage to be taken out of whatever comes in and that will automatically be sent to your reserve. I've never had any issues with them. They don't nickel and dime you with fees. They really are the most supportive bank I've ever worked with.\n",
            " - Does everything I need it to while not charging me anything. Simple as that!\n",
            " - Love it! Free, easy to use, auto splits my accounts for meso I can follow profit first. I cand send invoices too and easily track everything!\n",
            " - So simple, responsive, and works. As a new startup I’ve loved this approach to banking. I do miss walking into a local spot and meeting the people, but Novo keeps it simple. Also, received the best funding option to help my business grow through Novo.\n",
            " - I love Novo. The app is simple, but allows for me to automatically separate taxes from payments. The support is excellent. Responsive and helpful. Transfers within the US and internationally are quick and easy. I wish all banking was this intuitive and user friendly!\n",
            " - She listened to my explanation, understood what I was saying and responded accordingly with maximum professionalism. Thank you!\n",
            " - Some things need work, but they are pretty responsive.\n",
            " - The app access, invoicing tool, app links to other sources like PayPal and Venmo, and the ability to get excel spreadsheets of financial activity is great for my small businesses.\n",
            " - Convenient and connected to other apps for savings.\n",
            " - I love banking without the extra fees. I thought I wouldn't like not having a physical bank for my business but it's been great so far. Any issues have been delt with immediately.\n",
            " - Slow. No way to add the card to Apple Pay. It updates spending really slow.\n",
            " - I have 2 business accounts with Novo and I am about to open a third. The integration is top shelf for me. My NOVO checking account merges seamlessly with my Accounting software (Quickbooks). As an e-commerce business, POS payment (SQUARE) integrates seamlessly as well. Most recently, I have received micro lending which has really helped with my capital/business expansion. I’m here for all of it! Thank you Novo for giving me the freedom to run my business empire!!!!\n",
            " - I've tried many different business banks and by far Novo has given me the best experience. Everything about it is polished and top-notch.\n",
            " - I'm wasting too much time asking for limmit increases, waiting until it's approved and then the app failed to reflect the increase so I had to ask again.....I'm looking for a new bank.\n",
            " - The unauthorized charge dispute process is frustrating. Requiring documentation showing I've contacted a vendor about an unauthorized charge doesn't make much sense and requiring PDF files but not clearly stating a PDF is the only form of document you accept only makes it worse.\n",
            " - Need better interface for transactions. Show balance after transaction\n",
            " - I've been using them for my business for over a year now. I barely notice. They do the job well, and I don't have to be bothered much. That's old school banking in a well designed online experience. UX Designer\n",
            " - Very user friendly with good tech support.  The integration are very useful as well\n",
            " - Great atm benefits. All costs are reimbursed\n",
            " - Novo has provided the very best banking (online or brick & mortar) experience that I've ever had. It's easy to access, full of features, and I never pay a fee, ever!\n",
            " - I got to have a zoom meeting with the people who work at the bank, it made it very personal to meet the people that work there.\n",
            " - Simple and great value!  Has everything I need as a self employed llc and love the simplicity and features it gets out of the gate.  no fee on domestic transfer is amazing for my everyday business.\n",
            " - I have been with Novo for a few years now, and have recommended them to several other entrepreneurs. I LOVE their service, and the features they offer. Having virtual accounts I can allocate money towards taxes, or large expenses has been a game changer.\n",
            " - I absolutely love banking with Novo. What I live most is the reserves and being able to automatically split all my deposits as soon as they hit my bank. I would recommend it to anybody\n",
            " - How much easier can banking get??? Nothing beats Novo in my opinion. Extremely convenient, no hassle banking from anywhere. Just need your phone or a computer and you’re in business. Pair it with Stripe and you’re off to the races!\n",
            " - Working with Novo is so much easier than my other brick and mortar accounts.  Easily accessed, robust online banking, everything I need without the hassle.\n",
            " - The ease to setup was phenomenal and the third party apps are a plus!\n",
            " - I'm a small business artist and love how many apps sync and work smoothly with novo. Very easy mobile deposits and helps create reserves for different goals and money pockets (for vending, taxes, etc)\n",
            " - Cool bank amazing business focus financial system in place\n",
            " - excellent alternative to traditional banking\n",
            " - They offer solutions that are truly designed for businesses. Reserves, funding, integrations, robust mobile app - everything is on point. The customer service is exquisite as well. I've had nothing but positive experiences.\n",
            " - Novo is a great online bank- I love all the integrations, the reserves, and how easy it is to handle our money.The one major downside for me is that they don't provide manual checks. They will send checks for free to your payees using their system, but that doesn't always work when I need to submit a check with a form, or send one to Canada. I found a workaround and ordered my own checks using the info on a canceled check, but it was a hassle and risk to even try doing that, since their customer support ensured me it wasn't possible or allowed.\n",
            " - They have not given me any reason to not trust them. They keep releasing good features and even new finance products for my small business(es).\n",
            " - I really adore Novo. The reserves that allow you to divvy up all incoming cash flow have saved my bacon. I have a reserve for taxes, so a certain percentage automatically gets taken out and set aside. They’ve been super helpful, and I’ve honestly never had a single issue in two years. Everything runs like clockwork.\n",
            " - Novo has been consistently amazing.  I've always had positive experiences and look forward to many more years with them!  Highly recommended!\n",
            " - Hiii good night byee bro I am so happy for you to be series of the year old boy\n",
            " - honest review. this app is subpar it has a little to keep you but overall there is a lot of better banking systems more updated better customer service with atms that you will be able to cash deposit or withradw and more funding. the mobile  deposit check pictures suck. i'm with them for now until i can find a better bank. if you can get a better bank do it please!\n",
            " - Novo has been a game changer for our business. Great tools and easy interface. They have a lot of features that have helped us grow and scale our products.\n",
            " - best bank for running your business of any scale, tried all of them.\n",
            " - Novo has exceeded my expectations. Incredible group and product. I was introduced to Novo via my Profit First (read the book) group.\n",
            " - Novo is convenient and simple to use and helps keep me in business because of the 0 fees and no monthly charges.I wish I could see a before amount in my account balance. Like before and after a purchases so I can keep track better on my finances.\n",
            " - Very responsive. Quick replies to inquiries.  Extremely helpful folks who care about small business\n",
            " - They are convenient for the smaller business but they hold deposits for a week. That is not good. You will need a local bank to supplement Novo's shortcomings on fund availability and when you grow weary of having to constantly take pics of the same check because their system doesn't pick it up.\n",
            " - They understand the pains of Entrepreneurs when it comes to managing money and makes it easier to do business unlike larger banks.\n",
            " - I love my bank Novo! So many great features, no fees, & great rates on loans! Will never leave.\n",
            " - Works well. Can potentially be offered a credit line.\n",
            " - My favorite online business bank account I have used them for 3 of my LLCs for over 3 years now and really appreciated their financial tools and how they have continually invested the user experience\n",
            " - I needed funding for my small business, and honestly I wasn't sure I could even get funding.  I bank with Novo, so when the opportunity arrived to apply for funding via Novo I thought I would give it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the application process was, and I was funded within 24 hours!  The team at Novo really has small businesses in mind, and they make things so easy!\n",
            " - Very attentive to my requests and didn’t take a long time to do so\n",

            " - Greatest banking service for emerging businesses preparing to scale.\n",

            " - I really enjoy novo Bank. I would really recommend it, if you just started a business . Also if your a person that like to do everything online , not go to the bank in person\n",
            " - Novo has gone above and beyond my expectations\n",
            " - Best business bank. Perfect for profit first\n",
            " - I love the ease of Bank Novo's online services.\n",
            " - Responsive, secure, friendly, innovative, low cost.  Great for a new business or self-employed person.\n",
            " - It's been a great resource for me over the last couple of years as I've started my business. I love the new tools they keep adding and I'm excited to see how they continue to grow.\n",
            " - I’ve had no issues or snafus. Set up was super easy. I love that I can make different reserves for my different goals and for direct access and movement of my money. I love that there’s an option for a direct loan and my rep has been great with communication. All in all, very happy with my experience.\n",
            " - I highly recommend Novo! Having started from scratch, my funds weren't exactly as I wished and it seemed I would never catch up, much less profit. When I discovered Novo, I discovered a whole new outlook in the business. With Novo by my side, and the different programs offered, services available and the overall function of Novo, I've not only profited but became successfully in my business.\n",
            " - They pulled funds from my personal accounts causing overdraft fees and payments like my mortgage to be returned unpaid.\n",
            " - Been with them for 2 years now. Haven't been with any other business bank, but I haven't had any reason to switch yet. I do wish that payments came a day or two faster, but overall my experience has been positive and reliable.\n",

            " - I have been using Bank Novo for a couple of years now and have been very happy. Online banking is very convenient and allows me to do everything I need to do right from the app or desktop version.\n",
            " - fantastic online-only business banking. I especially love the ability to create 'reserves' that work like sub-accounts where I can allocate payroll, tax savings, profits, etc and really manage my business finances well.\n",
            " - Truly fee free unlike many that claim to be.\n",
            " - Easy banking system. Constant updates. I really like that it immediately notifies me everytime a purchase is made. It immediately declines and freezes transactions if there is any suspicious activity.\n",
            " - This is the best business online bank ever , I love the allocation of funds automatically that you can set up percentages that come out when money comes in\n",
            " - Novo has been great for our short term rental property. We follow the Profit First system and Novo's sub-accounts make automating our allocations extremely easy.\n",
            " - Great for SMBs. Been here since 2020.\n",

            " - The application and funding process were very straightforward and transparent.\n",
            " - Novo has been flawless from day one in how their services have been helpful for this company. Somehow they're still improving by adding new programs and features, which have always been exceptionally simple to use. I've been recommending Novo to other people for their businesses, and they're happy too.\n",
            " - Great Bank! Switched from Azlo, Have been loving it!\n",
            " - Great bank! Just wish they  had zelle but I believe it's in the works! Would choose them again.\n",
            " - UI cleanliness. Easy integration. Well programmed. No complications. Smoothing experience I’ve ever had with a bank. Never want to go anywhere else.\n",
            " - Works well, clearly, easily. Everything is as presented. Transfers are easy and are completed in a reasonable amount of time, single day transfers are fairly priced. Integrations are awesome and make life easier. Funding program is a great benefit as well.\n",
            " - Great to work with, easy, reliable and provided capital with ease when needed. I didn't have to apply for the capital they automatically provided an amount by my average sales & direct deposit amounts when I needed.\n",
            " - Amazing bank and I definitely recommend it to others.I’m a contractor and sending invoices through here is so convenient and so easy. First couple invoices took awhile to get through but after 3-4 invoices they come in usually the next day or day after which is really nice and quick You can also pay your employees directly through this app which is great !\n",
            " - I've used Novo for multiple businesses and never had an issue.  Ease of use is awesome!\n",
            " - Functionality\n",
            " - My approval literally took minutes, as described in the email. I had immediate access to the funding with all disclosures and only a soft pull to my personal credit.\n",
            " - I've been with novo for almost 2 years and I absolutely love them! They are very responsive and anytime you request a feature it gets added on quickly. You can easily organize your funds and create different folders for savings. 100% recommend of small businesses.\n",
            " - This platform and its team rocks. Great experience after one full year of using them.\n",
            " - I love the ease of the system. My issue is I would like to speak with a love person when there is an immediate issue. In addition, sine the new cards have been released, we are now unable to categorize our purchases. This was helpful as this is my business account.\n",
            " - The absolute best bank for any start-up! From day 1 there has been so many great things and they continue to make the experience better!\n",
            " - So far I really like NOVO, I have not had any problems. I really like how careful they are with security and verifications. I feel safe with them.\n",
            " - 4/5 stars since I'm picky, but overall I love the simplicity of Novo's UX and how they help small businesses. I love the \"Reserves\" feature which allows me to customize categories I want to set aside funds for. (ex: taxes, fees, operating expenses) There's also a newer feature which allows each transaction deposited in your account to allocate a percentage (ex: 25% allocated to my taxes Reserve). The -star is because I wish the main in/out transactions could be organized slightly better, which smaller text / the individual dates taking up less phone screen space... I think there can be better filtering for \"Your Activity\" to differentiate daily vs monthly vs annual vs Other transactions. But I only use Novo for very simple basic needs, so that's me being picky. Overall, GREAT for organizing business income vs expenses if you're trying to avoid commingling of funds.\n",
            " - I absolutely love Novo! Their app is incredibly user-friendly with a sleek design, making managing my finances a breeze. The addition of the reserves feature sets them apart, providing me with excellent control and flexibility. I'm excited to see what's in store for future products and features!\n",
            " - Fairly easy to deal with, could improve processing time on deposits.\n",
            " - As a startup this was a very I've surpriseThank you Novon\n",
            " - Great bank with amazingly easy access to business funding.just a few clicks and borrowed $3k couldn’t believe I didn’t have to wait for a loan officer or something along those lines to go through my info and lower my credit score by pulling my credit report. They have things figured out unlike most banks.\n",
            " - I enjoy that they have a well-functioning platform that continues to improve. I have had no issues with Novo.\n",
            " - I love Novo! It was eady to sign up for my account. I have had it for over a year and the perks are unmatched.\n",
            " - They did not resolve or seem to understand my issue.\n",
            " - I am unable to claim the Stripe Perk.  Lots of finger pointing back and forth.  There doesn't appear to be any formal process to actually get the Stripe Perk.4/27/23 - Edit:  @Novo, where should I send the business name?\n",

            " - So far, I really love this bank. I have been able to better keep up with our finances and allocate percentages using the reserves option in the account to get us into a Profit First model for our business without having a lot of different accounts. I also love that you can create checks and they send them for you.\n",
            " - Great communication and services offered by the company. Always keeping me as their customer updated with important information. Great company to go with for anything banking related they offer. Has helped me focus energy and time into my business growth.\n",
            " - A business overcharged me in September I filed a claim nothing happened as of yet. Customer support was very rude I am going to navy federal.\n",
            " - Minimal requirements to open up an account, ease of use. Minimal fees.\n",
            " - Love Novo, they have a modern interface and are the bank of the future.\n",
            " - I have been with Novo since 2020 and honestly it has been a good experience. I have never had an issue with them. It got better when they added Novo funding! I just would like them to give higher funding limits as well as offer business credit cards..that would make them exceptional!\n",

I also like the fact that I can connect to other apps. The app makes it easy for me to move money around. I am an entrepreneur with a fairly new business. Novo is the first bank who gave me a tradeline to help me build my business’credit. I really can’t think of a reason not to use this online bank.\n",

            " - As a freelancer, I love Novo. I've never used an online bank but this just made sense for the way my business operates. It allows me to separate my personal finances from my business without having a lot of rules such as daily fees.\n",
            " - This is a fanstaic bank. They are always looking for ways to help my business grow. I can't say enough good things about them.\n",
            " - I’ve been using Novo for about 2 years now and no complaints.\n",

            " - Simple to use and perfect for what I need.  I haven't experienced any issues since I began using over a year ago.\n",
            " - I have been using NOVO and liked jt a lot.When I have issues, customers service has not failed to solve them. They have live person you can talk to and they answer your calls pretty quickly. Unlike Bluevine business which I also have, NOVO can provide separate cards for business partners and this is awesome to have! Thank you NOVO!\n",
            " - This bank has been nothing but amazing. They are extremely informative and helpful. The quality of integrations is super helpful and the UI/UX is probably much better than those of traditional banks. I am very pleased with my experience.\n",
            " - Top notch company, my business is in good hands with Novo.\n",
            " - I like to use my mobile devices and this online banking company makes it lot more easier and more convenient for my likings.\n",
            " - Novo made my previous bank look like amateurs. With Novo, I get big business bank features like ACH transfers for my small business. Not only that, their integrations to stripe and other services gives me a fantastic overview of my business as soon as I log in. My vendors have been impressed by the automatic updates novo sends to the recipient of both ACH and Printed checks. I have been with Novo for a couple of years now. It started with me getting frustrated with my existing bank.\n",
            " - Novo is a clean interface for a bank. It also has clear reports with visuals that help.\n",
            " - There app is so user friendly and unlike any other business account you will find. I love the reserves feature where you can create automated savings rules for different categories. It makes it super easy for me to save for taxes, operating expenses, etc.\n",
            " - Novo is fantastic! They are more than just banking which makes them stand out and easy to recommend. My absolute favorite feature is the reserves feature. Great for saving for specific things or (what I use it for) automatically dividing income into categories like, saving, tax, paydays, marketing, giving, upgrades.\n",
            " - Invoicing is a piece of cake with Novo. No fees for incoming wire transfers is how it should be. Traditional banks need to watch and learn.\n",
            " - If you are looking to implement Profit First in your business and are concerned about having to open multiple accounts, then use Novo. With Novo, you can manage your funds more efficiently and make sure that each separate Profit First account receives the correct amount of money for the desired purpose automatically. This means you will never have to worry about accidentally depositing too much or too little money into any one account. Novo is the perfect solution for anyone looking to incorporate Profit First into their business model. Thanks for this great functionality!\n",
            " - Leveraging and developing the technology I needed to really make my business finances a no brainer.Grateful for the team at Novo for developing a fantastic product 🙏\n",
            " - Rejecting my request for transaction limit increases has really soured my impression of NOVO, they fail to realize I can't run my business with such low limits. I'm now looking for a real bank.\n",
            " - I’ve been with Novo for almost two years. As a brand new business owner I needed to have an easy bank. I found that with Novo. No fees. Money is there quickly. Payroll is always on time. Easy to do electronic transfers. I couldn’t ask for more with a bank.\n",
            " - I LOVE the fact that we can have multiple reserve accounts and have set transfer percentages very easily. The ease of adding deposit accounts is wonderful. I would like an easier way for assistance when an issue does arise. I also did have an issue mailing a check and since have switched to ACH deposits for that payee. Overall, I love working with Novo.co\n",
            " - I have been using Novo for a year or so now. The best part about my banking experience with them would have to be the reserves. I set up the reserves to auto-allocate funds from my pay checks to Savings, Taxes, and State taxes.\n",
            " - Honestly Novo is an amazing company for startups and existing companies. Very user friendly and nice features to help your business grow!\n",
            " - Their app is excellent. Very easy to use and seems really geared toward the user. Much more than large commercial banks. Appreciate the seamless integration with Stripe and of course the very low transaction costs. This company is nimble enough to be ahead of the technology curve!\n",
            " - I chose Novo because of no fees — on virtually ANYTHING, including international wires. It's also very convenient to have invoices built-in to the platform. They are quickly adding new features and I have not yet had an issue with them.\n",
            " - Years of using over priced business accounts, Novo goes above and beyond. Easy to set up, let's me move money and pay contractors super easily, invoice and get paid internationally which helps my business.Good support team and lots of plugins to important tools to grow a business. Best business account I've ever had, and been an entrepreneur for well over 30 years.\n",
            " - I love Novo! They have amazing features and a seamless user experience.\n",
            " - I love Novo!It's been smooth sailing from the start, they are really helping small businesses take control of their finances. Very grateful to work with them.\n",
            " - All that I need for my banking needs.Wonderful experience\n",
            " - I have had an excellent experience with Novo so far and am very happy I switched to this bank. I love their mobile app.\n",
            " - They take traditional banking and give it a great experience for businesses to show the info businesses need, and give the tools to help. The Reserves capabilitiy has been critical to our cash flow management. I use 8 reserves to divide up revenue across capital, taxes, owner compensation, etc. It's a much better banking experience.\n",
            " - Great platform, integrations, and perks!\n",
            " - Great bank with no fees and staff response is timely and friendly!\n",
            " - Novo is a great bank that I trust to run my business. My favorite feature is the instant payout integration with Stripe.\n",
            " - I love the ability to send invoiced and have all business expenses in one place\n",
            " - Couldn’t be much happier with a banking institution, have had only positive transaction experiences, app has been flawless, integration is easy, highly recommended.\n",
            " - I love using novo and recommend it to all my fellow self employed business owners! I haven't had a single negative experience with them and really love the ability to set aside funds in a reserve for when quarterly estimated taxes are due.\n",
            " - This is by far the best bank, especially for small business entrepreneurs! They offer so many perks, are not gluttons for fees, and just feels like they're in my corner supporting my business grow. I can make invoices, transfer money easily, create reserves/buckets for special savings brackets + more. I haven't had to use their customer service yet because everything works amazing. Although I'd say it speaks volumes that I haven't needed to call customer service for anything in the year that I've had them as my primary business bank.\n",
            " - Responsive, quick turnaround. Just what I need\n",
            " - I enjoy Novo online business banking. Using the app is very user friendly. I am able to get my invoices out in a timely manner. It's also easy to keep track of expenses.\n",
            " - Great for simple company based in the USA Could be better for a company that does business outside of the USA and in need of invoicing and payment in Multiple currencies\n",
            " - Been using novo for a little over a year. Easy to sign up, easy to use, approved for a cash advance within a year, and a clean UI. Amazing experience. Their integration with stripe saved me hundreds in fees and I usually get next day payouts from stripe without incurring extra stripe fees. It’s easy to create reserve buckets and transfer money in or out.  Finally, atm fee reimbursement. Saved me at least 200 over the past year!\n",
            " - Novo is the best virtual bank for nonprofits. The sh timer service, while kind, takes a while to respond and doesn’t always have the correct answers to questions. We stick with Novo because no brick and mortar has the services they do like free ACH transfers, no minimum balance but the customer service leaves something to be desired.\n",
            " - Made the process very easy with simple instruction.  Quick response. Ability to do online without need to print documents.\n",
            " - I've been using Novo for about a year now. I appreciate the many apps and integrations provided to run my small business. I look forward to seeing it grow into more tax friendly organizational apps to make life easier to submit items to our accountants.\n",
            " - No bank fees or charges. Thank you very much!\n",
            " - I love having the option to easily create reserves to save portions of my business income for taxes, PTO, trainings, etc.\n",
            " - When I say, this is the perfect banking app for small businesses. I love how I can create different reserves and don’t have to worry about calculating my quarterly taxes from my sales. I wish they had the instant option for payments used from cashapp but it’s fine. I still receive it within 30 mins. Also, adding Afterpay would be great. Overall, I love you guys\n",
            " - As a small individual consultant, I'm really grateful for the support and ease of use that Novo has provided me. I was trying to figure out how to receive funds from oversees and their support was exceptional.\n",
            " - Novo has made running my small Handyman business so much easier. I love the fact that I can categorize, add notes, and receipts for each transaction. Because of this I don’t need a separate bookkeeping system. I enjoy the app so much that even made a video about it on my YouTube channel @handymanprocess.\n",
            " - The company needs to be ready to partner with existing businesses to provide low rate affordable loans for both working capital and expansion.\n",
            " - Best online bank I’ve ever worked with. I don’t think I’ve touched paper for them in the year and 2 months I’ve been with them. Great customer service, they usually reply within an hour or two every time. I use this for my business checking and it’s been incredible so far. Can easily pay freelancers in just a few clicks on the app. Can deposit checks super fast. Way better than any other online bank I’ve ever worked with.\n",
            " - I needed a business account & Novo has made it extremely convenient to operate the finances of my business! I also love that it integrates with my Shopify store!!\n",
            " - Very smooth banking - the app makes things simple & fast.\n",
            " - Novo is very easy to use and is a game changer for those working remotely. The setup process was by far the easiest I've ever experienced and the fact that they are continuing to bring innovation into their product is essential for me as a customer because I know it will only continue to get better.\n",
            " - I’ve been with Novo when my bank closed down and it’s been amazing and seamless ever since. I love that I had the opportunity to see Novo grow and blossom\n",
            " - Everything was so easy to set and get started. Help save money with their partnership programs with other apps/systems.\n",
            " - What I love about NOVO is that they regularly respond to feedback, update features to make them better, and introduce new ones that are actually helpful. As opposed to most banks, they seem to center the experience of their clients. I won’t be leaving anytime soon!\n",
            " - My first choice and I'm glad I chose Novo, or did they choose me?\n",
            " - The software and app are very good and I appreciate the new features coming out regularly.\n",
            " - I've been with Novo for 2 years now and absolutely LOVE them! Never had an issue of any kind. They offer so many extra features to run my business. Not to mention the cash flow lending option! This is truly the best bank to use for your business.\n",
            " - Disgusting service for offshore clients who had money stolen by Esoirito. We are told to go to a local branch but we don't have one anymore.\n",
            " - Amazing how something free can be that good\n",
            " - Do not use this f****ng bank Noone fuc*ing helps you they steal your fuc*ing money this is day 5 no response over $3000$ gone\n",
            " - Here is the customer support number for Novo. +1-844-260-6800. Don’t be surprised to get someone on the phone with dogs barking and babies crying in the background while they are cooking breakfast, lunch, or dinner. These people are very unprofessional and will pretend to be interested in helping you. I had no luck, but at least I was able to speak with an actual person. Maybe you’ll have better luck.\n",
            " - Nothing but CONSTANT technical problems with this bank (PAIRED with absolutely no support). Hours and hours and hours trying to do the most simple things (logging in, making transfers, downloading statements.....ya know....THE THINGS THAT THE PRODUCT IS SUPPOSED TO INHERENTLY DO)......Truly awful. Out of the dozens of financial accounts I use and have used over the years between my personal and professional lives, novo is the worst.\n",
            " - I recently tried out Novo and have been very disappointed with the experience. The app is slow and outdated, and it often crashes or freezes when I try to use it. The features are also quite limited; it's hard to do anything more than check my balance and pay bills.\n",
            " - Novo worst product\n",
            " - I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience with Novo Business Banking. My account was deactivated arbitrarily and without any communication, leaving me unable to access my invoices and financial information. The customer service team was either unable or unwilling to restore my account, and I was left with no choice but to re-invoice all of my existing customers. This has caused significant inconvenience and has negatively impacted my business relationships. I am extremely disappointed in the lack of support and communication from Novo Business Banking and would not recommend their services to anyone.\n",
            " - Very happy using Novo. It is simple to use. It is accessible on app. It has multi-safety features and is extremely reliable.\n",
            " - Never had an trouble with them and they continue to improve on the product.  I wish the debit cards would ship faster, but besides that no problems here!\n",
            " - Ease of use and access to financial activity.\n",
            " - Convenient Online Banking. Not sure how much control Novo has over how fast mobile check deposits take. Not sure I can pin my only complaint on Novo. App is great.\n",
            " - I've been using Novo since 2020. I've had zero problems. They are definitely one of the best digital banks. I recommend them.\n",
            " - It has the minimums of usability expected of an online bank. Enough to score more than 1 star, but I suspect anyone rating it higher than 2 stars has not had to use their support, not had problems to solve, not had to use the virtual credit card, and have not had to request any changes to transfers, credit limits, or any form of assistance. It's easy to say 5 stars when you haven't experienced any of those aspects. After more familiarity with all aspects of services and support, it is clearly below average, but also not the worst- the perfect example of 2-stars.\n",
            " - Fully equipped with all kind of money transfer\n",
            " - The NOVO Team is always willing to help with any issues that come up and that makes my job so much easier!\n",
            " - I need to be able to reach a person when things get confused by standard banking.\n",
            " - So far I love Novo...No issues and love the application integrations\n",
            " - Best banking experience I've had, and I love the app. The gamechanger though is how fast I can receive my payments via Stripe through Novo!\n",
            " - I love using NOVO because of its simplicity. The app is very user friendly. I’ve been using them for over a year and have not experienced any issues.\n",
            " - Love Novo! Been using this bank for my business ever since Azlo shut down.\n",
            " - I've had a Novo account for about four months and I'm loving it. I created an account because I'm following the Profit First method and wanted an account that would allow me to make reserves for savings, profit, etc. and Novo lets me to just that. There are also great features like the Stripe integration that allows you to get your payouts faster. Highly recommend.\n",
            " - Very trusting and super 100% customer friendly.  I love it, honestly.  The app allows me to view transactions and that keeps my taxes really easy.\n",
            " - I have several bank accounts to keep my business income separate based on the profit first method. But, with Novo, I don't even need my other accounts. The automatic separation of my income into several envelopes saves me so much time.My transfers from Novo are always prompt. I couldn't be happier with my banking experience.\n",
            " - Fast, reliable and smartly made online bank for my small business. Really appreciate the “reserve” feature the divvies up every dollar I get into percentage-based buckets.\n",
            " - Great digital bank, responsive support when needed.\n",
            " - I love my experience with Bank Novo! I wish there were more opportunities to get money.\n",
            " - Novo is the cleanest business banking experience I've ever had.Cheap, easy, secure, and connects with stripe with flying colors.\n",
            " - Great communication. Fast processing of requests. Prompt payments into the account. Full service, including wire transfers, ACH payment processing, credit card linking, and ability to connect with other banking/financial institutions. The App sometimes glitches, but with a reboot (close reopen) it is usually resolved.\n",
            " - I love how I can implement Profit First with Novo\n",
            " - I have been using Novo for about 6 months and so far it's been pretty good. I have had to reach out for support maybe twice and they respond very quickly.\n",
            " - Novo has been a great online bank so far. They integrate nicely with stripe, quickbooks, and more. I also appreciate their invoicing feature.\n",
            " - Love the app! Works well. Their Reserves feature comes in handy.\n",
            " - Listen this community is amazing for small business owners.  I tell everyone I know about Novo.  They listen to customer feedback.  I have enjoyed Novo since I became part of the group over a year ago I believe.  Keep doing what your doing.\n",
            " - I love the ease of using the app and desktop site for managing my bank account! Reserves are an excellent tool for my business as well.\n",
            " - Great business checking for beginners. Always looking to help.\n",
            " - Easy to enroll, love the reserves to assist with running a profits first company.\n",
            " - Great SBA banker. No hassle and seamless interfaces\n",
            " - I love NOVO!It's user friendly, they provide so many options on how your business can succeed.  Also, create reserves to help you manage your money.\n",
            " - Very satisfied with your Novo servo\n",
            " - Easy process and recognition of a long customer was an added benefit.\n",
            " - I love the idea of Novo, everything being in one place such as strip/shopify payments among other features. Also providing funding as well the same way shopify does is amazing also. I love this bank and will continue to use them for other businesses as well.\n",
            " - I am very happy with Novo bank, very professional.\n",
            " - Novo has been a very smooth experience in the start up of my business. It’s easy to stay organized and keep records. I would highly recommend.Opportunities for improvement are offering a business credit card or partnership to link one in some way. And access to Zelle or Venmo.\n",
            " - Excellent money app! If you're a freelancer, then look no more.\n",
            " - They do not make you feel like just another customer. Quick to respond and resolve.\n",
            " - I enjoy using NOVO bank for my Small Business needs. I have run into an encounter with effective and efficient communication with customer service and got it rectified after contacting the CEOs but other than that, I love the ease of NOVO.\n",
            " - I'm glad that I found a bank that is tailored for small businesses and easy to obtain.  Missing Zelle though!\n",
            " - NOVO offers me a complete banking service, including holding a checking, paying, invoicing and being paid by ANY payment method absolutely for free. No fees and no minimum to worry about. For a small business like mine, what is left to ask for? I am very happy with the service. The app is simple to use and straighforward, even for an older guy like me... lol\n",
            " - They are responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend them!\n",
            " - I was extremely nervous starting my business. They have been there with me and assisted me at every step. They have provided me quick and useful communication when I have questions/concerns about Mt accounts.  I am so thankful that Novo provides me services that other banks/lending institutions do not. They are consistently offering new and USEFUL features. The reserves feature is a game changer alone!The speed of transactions is INCREDIBLE. It seems like I'm always waiting on the more \"traditional\" institutions to complete activities.\n",
            " - Love the modern look, feel, and functionality of Novo Bank. I spent a long time looking for the right bank that would work for my online, and remote business, and not charge big fees. Luckily Novo solved all my problems and I've used it for over 5 businesses now.\n",
            " - Novo has truly been an amazingly positive experience.Aside from no Zelle, they're great at every level, and we haven't even thought about other banks again.If you're looking for a no BS, no fee, back for your business, we strongly recommend Novo Bank:Use this link and get $40.00:t dot ly slash Pcod\n",
            " - I love using Novo for my business banking. The stripe integration, multiple reserves, and referral program has been a great asset to my business.What I think Novo needs to improve on is it's customer support and it's fraud prevention. I have referred Novo to so many people only to find that they had terrible experiences with Novo (hackers charging thousands to their accounts and the support team being incredibly unhelpful in solving this issue). It spooked me out because I do not want my money to be vulnerable and asked the support team if I could have some reassurance on specifics from their fraud prevention team.I did not find their support team helpful and did not get any specifics on their fraud prevention processes.I have noticed that now, I get text messages that alert me every time I log in to make sure it is safe, double check the url and email, etc. This is an improvement.It just sucks when I spoke so highly of Novo within my network and recommended Novo to many businesses only to see that their experiences were one of fraud, lack of security, and their funds vulnerable. I hope Novo continues to improve their safety + security measures.The app itself is user friendly, with awesome integrations, and this is why I give it four stars.\n",
            " - Great bank, makes business easy for me when it comes to taxes and staying organized\n",
            " - Love growing with Novo. The features they have implemented are amazing and it surprises me that other major and established business banks don’t even offer those features.\n",
            " - The feature that Novo offers for businesses is awesome, I love the ability to make reserves within my account.\n",
            " - There are several features that Novo provides that have been game-changers for me. Automatic reserves and invoicing via Stripe are my two favorite things about banking with Novo.\n",
            " - Looking at the date of the positive reviews, it appears that Novo hired someone to counteract the negative responses with fake accounts probably ….reporting great reviews. This so called bank has NO reliable customer service. Getting hold of a actual person to discuss the problem is impossible.\n",
            " - What a s*** storm. This bank does NOTHING to protect its customers from fraud, moreover almost holds the customer responsible at the same time. Absolutely disgusting. How can they call themselves the best bank for small businesses when they cannot provide any accountability for the shortcomings of their technology and then hold the customer responsible for their own problems? Customer service is next to unresponsive and when they respond it’s a game of passing the buck from helpless representative to another helpless representative.  Unbelievable. The motivational quotes on top of the balance page are a cute touch.\n",
            " - I’m a small business and I truly can say Novo works for us!!  Very easy to apply and provides tools to invoice customer in a professional manner\n",
            " - I love using Novo for my small business! It connects to my payment processors easily, it allows you to have multiple \"envelopes\" to move money and put it aside for expenses or for sales tax reporting or whatever you want! There are so many more excellent features! And it's FREE! The only downside is that there's no physical location, so when I do my market booths, I have to deposit the money at our personal bank and then transfer the funds. That's the only downside I've experienced thus far!\n",
            " - Novo is doing things that no other business bank is doing. It is so business focused it makes the local banks look like amateurs. From the easy integrations with QB and Stripe, to the invoicing and easy ACH options, I find it pleasurable to use Novo. But by far the best feature is their Novo Boost partnership with Stripe. Stripe sends me money and says 2-3 days, Novo sees that and fronts me the money immediately. This is incredible for small business cash flow. Further, I took advantage of their $10k in free processing deal they had with Stripe. These are the types of things that make business owner's lives easier. They update their feature set frequently and I love that they are testing features with uses before they fully roll out. Keep up the fantastic work!\n",
            " - Great company hands down been with them for years now I ain't going anywhere\n",
            " - As a small business owner I really appreciate Novo's human-centered communications, especially their app which is the first banking app I've ever used that feels like it is a part of the 21st century. All the rest need to catch up with Novo.\n",
            " - As an independent Artist, I needed a good reliable business account that works w POS app integration and doesn’t weigh me down with fees! Novo has been perfect on that count.\n",
            " - Im currently stranded in Nebraska because NOVO again locked my cards. I’ve sent messages and called but no one will return calls and messages go unanswered. I’m going to have to sleep on my rental car tonight and it’s going to get down to 8 degrees tonight. I have no food and no way to get any. Novo has over $2k of my money but I can’t use it to save my life!\n",
            " - NOVO IS A FRAUD AND WONT RELEASE OUR MONEYNovo has been holding on to our funds for 2 months now claiming they are doing an investigation. Investigation on what really?. The most annoying part is their support response is always the same. Our fund is still currently trapped.\n",
            " - Novo Bank is making fraudulent claims regarding its virtual cards. These are recognized as prepaid cards, and completely useless when trying to use them with major vendors/merchants like Google.Just don't bother.\n",
            " - Reasonable rates and no hidden fees! Used their services for my start-up. It was a pleasure to work with them. But, as the business grows, you need additional services and facilities. So, I don’t recommend them for medium-sized companies.\n",
            " - I really hate to write this. But unfortunately I will not be buying from Novo again. I’m really disappointed. I love the styles. My partner bought me HELOISE/Black for my birthday back in June. I was so in love with them and had my eye on them for quite some time. The first time I wore them was out for my birthday lunch. The second time I wore them was the following weekend for my birthday party. The sole/heel fully detached from the bottom of the boot. I was so gutted. So I went back to the store and the lady was more than happy to exchange so I replaced them with the JEZEBEL/Black. Unfortunately after only 4 months of having them the heel has collapsed and they’re unfixable so I hate to say it but I will not be purchasing from NOVO again.\n",
            " - Love how it has everything I need in one place and I am easily able to set reserves to budget for expenses. I've been using them since the beginning of summer and it has made it so easy to send payments directly to my contractors' bank accounts and not have to hand out checks every time I need to pay them.\n",
            " - User friendly and responsive to my questions, integrates well with all my financial apps and business model. Thanks a Million!\n",
            " - Forced to do much of your banking on an app, instead of a computer with good security.  Not good for older people who don't live on their phone.\n",
            " - Novo has been exceptional as my financial institution for our ministry. Many great features like no hidden fees and simple transfers. I find the integration with Quickbooks very helpful as well. Kudos Novo.\n",
            " - Interface could be a little broader and recent activity doesn't always work but the system itself is fantastic and it definitelygets the job done for the best price when interlocked with other apps. Only downside is it doesn't work well with a business thats takes in a lot of cash.\n",
            " - Smooth transactions. Nice to be able to bank completely online!\n",
            " - Convenient and self-efficient!!!\n",
            " - Great invoicing system! Along with a slick user interface, haven't had any issues\n",
            " - I love everything about Novo! The ease of signing up, the great experience with the app, the timing of transfers, and the fantastic customer support!\n",
            " - just been doint business with NOVO for the past year and have had zero issues and for me thats worth five stars\n",
            " - An excellent option for a small to medium businesses. Thank you, I am happy in our partnership. Best, Maria\n",
            " - I really enjoy Novo because I haven't had a single complaint and everything is just smooth, fast and efficient.\n",
            " - Novo does what they say they are going to do. I really like this company. They never let me down.\n",
            " - very hard to operate when overseas and without access to SMS's customer service access is not easy. the options offered trigger \"code not valid\" after it is clearly not your mistake. I would discourage anyone to trust your business banking operation with this app.refer to my tweets @ArduinoGuille\n",
            " - So far I've loved the way I can set up reserve accounts so everything's automated and I don't have to worry how much money to put aside.\n",
            " - This banking experience has been better Capital One\n",
            " - We never have any trouble working with them. This is a great bank!\n",
            " - There's never a disappointment or unpleasant surprise when using Novo for my business banking.  Keep it up and thanks\n",
            " - Go with anyone else, just not Novo. Product is so far behind the competition and their customer facing teams take days to get anything done.\n",
            " - Love Novo..   It's AMAZING!!!\n",
            " - Novo is really easy to work with. I have been able to deposit checks with ease, and manage my account online seamlessly.\n",
            " - Novo Bank makes it easy for me to have a business banking account for a side business that has little to moderate activity depending on the season and my workflow. I like not having to worry about making deposits every month and I don't have to worry about any hidden fees or charges. It has been great for me to have piece of mind to protect my LLC even though it is not an every day business for me at this time in my life.\n",
            " - Effortless usage. The simplicity is everything as new business owner. Using Novo is high on my list of smart business decision.\n",
            " - I absolutely love Novo. Very easy to use and their support helped me resolve some issues as well as provide clarity on questions I had. They continue to make good updates and have integrations with popular credit card processing companies. Definitely worth banking with them.\n",
            " - I hadn't heard of Novo before I started researching for our dog training business.  They are online, but it is seamless.  We've had a great experience from deposits, to invoicing to making payments.\n",
            " - Great Bank will continue to use this for ACH payments, very awesome\n",
            " - Best business banking app! I’ve been using this for quit some time and I’m very pleased to have this app. I’m able to easily track expenses.\n",
            " - Novo has a very generous offer in partnership with credit card processing Stripe to that I’m very grateful\n",
            " - Love Novo. Has everything I want, except _possibly_ virtual account IDs to deposit directly to reserves, but I'm sure there's a complicated banking system reason for that.\n",
            " - Amazing online bank, wells fargo/chase/BOA/legacy banks can jump off a cliff, will never switch back as long as I liveFor optimal results read profit first when setting up novo\n",
            " - Since establishing my account with Novo I've had a great experience and the perks of being able to connect other apps to see the full picture of your biz finances is unmatched.\n",
            " - Things have been clear and user friendly which was important to me. It makes it easy to label and categorize income and expenses as they come in to include adding invoices and/or receipts to each transaction.\n",
            " - Was quick to setup and had a bunch of good tools to utilize\n",
            " - I love Novo! Easy app, moving money is a breeze and my fave feature is the reserves!\n",
            " - Novo is a good bank. Transactions take a little time to show up, but overall I’ve had no problems with this bank.\n",
            " - Solid online interaction. I love the invoice feature integrated, as well as the other applications that can be linked. Very helpful\n",
            " - Novo really focuses in delivering to the needs of small businesses, specially the ones that are getting going and cannot afford onerous fees.  It is simple, easy to integrate to the accounting software, and provides payment method flexibility.\n",
            " - What I loved was the process and application set up.\n",
            " - My favorite feature is the reserves! This was the main reason I transferred my business banking from a more well known bank (where I still keep my personal checking).\n",
            " - No zelle. Transfers take 3 da6s if bank to bank\n",
            " - Setting up your business account with NOVO is as easy as 1, 2, 3. They are constantly improving the user’s experience and practice frequent open communication. I love NOVO!\n",
            " - Novo makes processing my Customer's payments easy. The integration with Stripe allows immediate deposits.\n",
            " - I love Novo. I have a small sole proprietorship so I can’t afford to pay a lot of bank fees yet. Novo gives me everything I need pretty much for free!\n",
            " - Really good banking services. Has a lot of features that I've never had at other banks, like the ability to create virtual reserves. I have had multiple issues depositing mobile checks, hence the 4-star rating over 5. That said, I recommend NOVO to all of my freelancer colleagues.\n",
            " - I have enjoyed my experience with Novo since banking with them for my business. Everything I have needed can be handled through their app and turnaround times and response times are pretty quick. I’ve appreciated their follow through. It’s a great resource that also continues to expand on ways to become that much better.\n",
            " - Works well with my business. Integrates seamlessly with Quickbooks and they have the ability to send invoices. I wish they had recurring invoices because I have many monthly recurring clients. That's my only negative.\n",
            " - Need instant funds and need ATMs for deposits\n",
            " - A great banking source for my business. Easy to utilize app plus they refund any atm fees you may incure at other banks.\n",
            " - This bank is excellent. Great service. Amazing features. Thoughtful updates. Convenient integrations. My favorite part is the reserves and customizable auto distributions allowing for automated percentage deposits among various reserve buckets. It makes saving for taxes, charity, expansion, owner draws, continuing education, etc way way cleaner...and you can transfer or pay bills directly from those reserves. THANK YOU. They are always working to make the user experience and opportunities to manage money and business easier and better. No issues with banking or app or website so far and I've been with them almost a year. I love this bank and can't wait to see what other innovations they put into effect. If I could wish for anything else it would be interest on the reserves or a linked savings account, and checks (because some of us still have to work with dinosaurs!).\n",
            " - I have a small business and Novo has been an amazing opportunity to kick start with. It was very easy to sign up and start using. The app is running smoothly as well. User-friendly interface. I like how fast they react to new product suggestions. Never got any delays with my payments in or out. I wish they had a credit card too!\n",
            " - Does what I need it to do. Won't wow you with high-speed transactions (can perform some) but in terms of a business checking account it is pretty solid and with no fees I'm happy to continue using it.\n",
            " - I have been with Novo since I branded my business under an LLC! Novo is awesome and I am thrilled to be apart of them! I am excited that me and my business chose Novo. If I could change one thing it would be, being able to directly talk with some or chat with an actual person 24/7 but I know that these things take time. So, with that being said, “Novo is my business banking and Imma stick beside’em”:-)\n",
            " - Generally really happy with Novo and the features they provide. I do wish their mobile app could show a real time view of money (both available and projected balance), which every other bank seems able to do, and is so crucial to know where your cash position stands. After nearly 3 years with them, this still isn’t in place (though the web shows an accurate view of my balance). If that was solved for, I’d give them 5 stars\n",
            " - Great option for startups. Continuously improving their services and offerings.\n",
            " - This is a great alliance with my company. They do everything I need them to do to help me run my business. The ease of use with their mobile app helps me with my day-to-day activities\n",
            " - Unhappy about checks being denied only to be told I need to get another check from the customer to again be denied. Will be looking elsewhere. Totally would not recommend.\n",
            " - They rejected a deposit because they say it appeared to be altered. The check was perfectly written with no stray or corrected marks. I have to rethink the internet banking experience. I will share this experience with everyone\n",
            " - Since moving my business account to Novo, I've enjoyed a great customer experience. Whether it be the mobile app or the faster processing of payments, the experience far outweighs larger commercial institutions.\n",
            " - It’s been a couple of years and I can recommend the bank to small business owners for sure. You can connect the bank info to a lot of payment systems and be sure that you get paid and send payment easy and  on time\n",
            " - Was a seamless transfer to Novo from the previous online bank we had that closed. We haven't had any issues. Good app and overall experience. It's nice having a reserves option so we can put the appropriate funds aside for taxes or whatever else. Very easy to move money around and the integrations fit everything we need.\n",
            " - These guys ROCK! 5 Star all the way!! I could tell you about all the benefits, but I bet they say it better. Give them a shot, you'll never go back to banking in person again!\n",
            " - Nova awesome faster money movement, integrations\n",
            " - Novo has to be one of the worst business banking solutions I've worked with. From the lack of customer support (there is literally no phone number to call for support) to the abundance of false advertising about their \"Perks\" (which never work and which Novo has no motivation in helping you redeem), this platform is filled with empty promises while trailing behind its competitors with extra long deposit cycles, transfer limits, absence of a payroll solutions, and more. I have already reported Novo to the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency due to the above. I highly advise other small businesses to find a more trust-worthy, reliable, and responsive banking solution.\n",
            " - Our small business has used Novo from day 1. Their team has been reliable, supportive, and accommodating with our needs, ranging from trivial to absolutely critical. Their website and iOS app are clean, easy to use, and feature rich. It's surprising to say this about a banking service, but we have absolutely no complaints and look forward to using Novo's services well into the future as we grow.\n",
            " - BEST online/mobile bank period.✅ simple & intuitive✅ practical & efficient✅ does everything you'd expect from a bank✅ allows for a mobile lifestyle\n",
            " - I've been using Novo pretty much since it's inception. Okay, maybe not THAT early, but pretty early on.I love it.I run a fully digital business, so it has everything and anything I could need AND THEN SOME.If you are a digital nomad, then Novo is a slam dunk for invoicing, scheduling payments, setting up Stripe integrations, and so much more!\n",
            " - Novo keeps everything safe, simple, and effective for me and my business.\n",
            " - I used Novo for 1 1/2 years and it's been wonderful to use.\n",
            " - I was unable to access NOVO either via desktop, app or to update my Quickbooks Online connection during a 12 hour period.\n",
            " - I have been using Novo for about a year now and I have enjoyed the experience. Easy, online, and stress-free.\n",
            " - Nice, simple fee free and well-designed app for my business. I can't speak to fee structure for businesses with higher volumes, but as a service provider with a small number of monthly transactions it's been perfect.\n",
            " - This bank has no fraud department! Take a look at their social media profiles and you'll see most of the interactions are from angry small business owners who got hacked and found that the bank will not help them recover their deposits. Terrible security, non-existent support. The app, mobile experience, etc are all well and good, until you realize they can't keep your money safe and nobody has it as their job to protect you from theft.\n",
            " - Novo isn't helpful for a growing small business. A slow account support system makes depositing escalating amounts coming in from clients slow and opaque. Any growing company that relies on cash flow to sustain its growth should stay away. In the past month, Novo protocols govern depositing sums to our account has prevented us from depositing over $30K. That's money we could use to market, hire, grow. And Novo's software algorithmic approach to client management makes it difficult to deposit it.If you're a small outfit and intend to stay small, Novo makes sense. If you expect and plan on growth, it doesn't.\n",
            " - I have been happy with NOVO since the. minute I signed up. I have needed help once, was able to talk to a person and what I needed was tended to immediately. The app is user friendly, and I love how since I started there are so many more features and incentives. Thank you!\n",
            " - What's the most innovative modern futuristic banking system survive experienced very thankful to be a part of the error of banking that Novo presents!\n",
            " - Been with Novo for almost a year now and the limitation of only communicating with them through the app didn't present a problem until the app stopped working. There is no way to communicate with them, no phone number, no email, nothing and Middlesex Savings has no way to communicate with them. P.S. They are not accredited through the BBB either. I have a few thousand dollars currently missing that's preventing me from paying vendors and I'm stuck, there is nothing I can do.  I hope I help someone else avoid this experience by not choosing Novo\n",
            " - Novo is a great way to get banking services for your business without all the fees, minimum balance requirements and hassle I associate with brick and mortar banks. It was fast and easy to sign up and I have used them for a couple years now with no real problems. The only drawback would be for businesses that function mostly on cash, you would have to do things a bit differently for that.\n",
            " - This is the worst banking experience I've ever had. I would never, ever recommend Novo to anyone. They are slow, they are inconsistent with their rules, they have put my business at risk. I bought into the nice front-end experience and I got fooled. I am moving all three of my business. accounts off their platform for good. And I recommend everyone else stay away.\n",
            " - I love my Novo account I can handle all of my business’ financial transactions with ease.\n",
            " - Being a startup, the account was a life saver for us. We were able to grow our company with the features like free ACH and others. Highly recommended for startups and small companies.\n",
            " - From the start I found Novo to be easily accessible, willing to take on my business, and willing always to help streamline the process. Since signing up, things have been clear, simple, yet and completely effective in every way needed. I highly recommend Novo to any other entrepreneur starting out in business.\n",
            " - Good solid platform.  They are continuing to add new features.  The only real issue is the chargeback system.  It is heavily geared to work for merchants, not cardholders.  I had placed an order with the US Postal service for stamps and never received the order.  The government gave me the runaround and by the time I got the proof, NOVO would not let me chargeback.  I lost over $300 in undelivered stamps.\n",
            " - I tell every entrepreneur I meet to use Novo, it’s the best bank I have found!\n",
            " - I've been using Novo for a while with two separate businesses and I would recommend it for online businesses that are very small. The app works very well and I like that they're always adding new features. It has fulfilled my business needs so far. The support sucks though. It's usually not a problem, because the app works well most of the time, but there's bound to be a problem once in a while and because Novo doesn't really have customer support, it's a terrible experience when a problem does arise. Hopefully, as they grow they'll consider adding real support.\n",
            " - I love how clearly focused Novo is towards helping my small business. I especially like the reserves, as it helps me budget my money for different purposes.\n",
            " - It's been great.I needed a business account for reselling and this is working out very well. I'm not big time, I don't thibk that it matters, but Novo works, and I'm happy with it.\n",
            " - I'm glad I switched to Novo for my business after Bank of America put up the fees on my business account. Since I joined last year, Novo has improved the experience online and on the app and it's good to see they're investing in the platform. I like the digital debit card which I can set up with Apple Pay and PayPal and manage online to pay my business expenses. I appreciate the integration with Wise which I use a lot for my offshore clients. It was easy to set up bank feeds to Zoho Books which automates my business accounting. It's now more cost-effective to run my business which is great as the pandemic has been a slow period for me.  I'm really happy I made the switch.\n",
            " - Can’t beat Novo for online checking\n",
            " - I've been using Novo for my business for about two years and it's been a great experience. I love being able to use any ATM for free and sending payments to contractors is so fast and easy. My only complaint is that I had my virtual card info stolen a few months ago and getting the fraudulent charges reversed was a lengthy process.\n",
            " - Novo is the easiest, fastest way to keep your business finances in order. Payments out, payments in, accounting records, all online. Highly recommended!\n",
            " - Easy to install the business account, no fee transaction, secure with 2 methods authentication process and many more.\n",
            " - Banking with Novo is easy.  I love doing all of my banking through an app.  It integrated with Quickbooks really easily and reliably.  I have found no reason to even consider changing since it does everything that I need.\n",
            " - I was skeptical when first signing up for an online business account but I honestly don't remember why! My experience with NOVO has been nothing but top notch and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a simple, hassle free and cost effective way to manage their funds!\n",
            " - Novo has made my banking experience seamless. I love how they continue to enhance their platform with integrations, and faster deposits.\n",
            " - After taking days (and several in-person visits) to set up my old business account at a brick and mortar bank, Novo was a breeze.Really enjoy Novo’s features. The reserves are helpful allocating funds for taxes without having to create separate accounts. And the Stripe bonus is terrific. The QuickBooks integration had a couple hiccups, but I believe that is fixed now. I don't use paper checks, so I can't speak to the reviews about issues with that.No complaints. :)\n",
            " - As new e-business owner, it was important for me not to have to pay a bunch of fees just to have a business account. Specially in today's economy.\n",
            " - Joining NOVO has been a great experience for me, making it easy to make deposits directly from Square Reader.\n",
            " - I have a 1 person LLC for physical therapy services. NOVO is fast and simple for check deposits and transferring money. I love the Reserve category for my tax fund.\n",
            " - Awesome Bank Services\n",
            " - I've been using novo for a bit over a year (my previous online business bank was no longer being offered by it's parent bank and they made it particularly easy if you switched to novo) and my experience has been nothing but positive\n",
            " - An YouTube video included me to Novo Its one of the best thing I did for my business. I really love the partnership with others services for business so you know that it help with any other thing for the furture in your business.\n",
            " - I've been a Novo customer for 3 years now and have zero thoughts of ever leaving.  They've got an awesome, customizable platform so I can see the info that I want to see when I open my accounts.  Everything is user friendly.  And I've loved that the experience is catered to business owners.  Highly recommend!\n",
            " - If you have a small business and you want to deal with a bank that understands today's fintech economy Novo is for you.  They know that businesses are dealing with many ways for clients to pay for your products and services.  I love the fact that Novo integrates seamlessly with all kinds of apps, web services and accounting platforms.  Novo really does listen to it's clients and is constantly improving. Their app is excellent and goes everywhere I go.  I have my bank in my pocket.\n",
            " - Novo is the most user-friendly online bank interface (and I've used at least 5 over the years!). They keep making it better and better. The ability to sort funds into envelopes is tremendously helpful to a small business keeping track of taxes, payroll, profit, expenses, etc. Invoicing is simple and straightforward. It replaces adding yet another software to my tech stack. But what I most love are the inspirational, cheer-you-up quotes that change from day to day. It shows they really get their end-user and makes online banking a friendly and inspiring experience. I have referred them to many fellow entrepreneurs for ease of use.\n",
            " - Novo has been fantastic to work with alongside my SMB. I work in digital media and have clients all over the world. Mobile deposit of checks and transfer of funds has been seamless. I've also been able to use all of my desired tools for managing my business and they have integrated without an issue. I highly recommend Novo for anyone looking to move from the big named banks.\n",
            " - Novo has made launching and growing a business easier than I imagined!\n",
            " - Great Bank, is no doubt the best business bank I've had. Previously I used TD bank for business only and it was an insanely terrible experience with TD. Everything has been simple and easy with Novo.\n",
            " - This bank is perfect for online businesses! I haven'thad any issues for the past 2 years and recommendthem to everyone who owns a business. I don't usechecks or any payment providers besides Stripeand PayPal and have never had any issues. Paymentscome quickly and move quickly, plus the reserves areso handy to do Profit First, and they connect with somany services. I would love a savings account on theapp for future updates! Keep up the good work!\n",
            " - Novo is a terrific business bank.  Not only do you get some great features, they are always working to bring the best experience along with new and more refined features.\n",
            " - Never had any problems with Novo or the app .Pleasure by itself  .\n",
            " - I was stationed overseas when I started a small side business, and Novo was the perfect fit for us as I needed to do as much as possible online and not deal with a brick and mortar bank.  We have been with Novo since they launched, and they are very open to feedback to help improve for servicrs for their customers.\n",
            " - Nice to have a bank that doesn't nickel and dime you and have great online support!\n",
            " - Novo integrates seamlessly with my other softwares and apps. I've been especially impressed with the customer service follow-up when something isn't working right. Plus, it's beautiful and easy to navigate.\n",
            " - AWESOME!!! Novo is the best bank I have ever used!\n",
            " - Novo is so supportive of my business! They fulfill my requests for help and information quickly and connect on social media.\n",
            " - Novo is genuinely a “pro-small business” bank.They are flexible in transactions and offer critical services that are sure only to keep getting better.\n",
            " - No random fees, the option to have reserve accounts within my account, quick processing time, just a few of the reasons Novo has been a great business banking partner!\n",
            " - New features rolling out all the time.  The app and web are great!  They really listen to their customers!  Features I needed, they built!\n",
            " - Novo is great! User friendly interface, quick approval process and innovating design that keeps on improving!\n",
            " - Not much for fluff. I have banking needs. Novo serves them well.\n",
            " - I LOVE Novo. It is the bank I've always dreamed of, basically banking with a millenial vibe and emphasis on a clean aesthetic and efficiency. I recommend it to every business owner I know and I'm so grateful that I found this platform so early into my entrepreneurial chapter.\n",
            " - You should RUN from this fintech company,  they are not a bank and have ridiculous rules that change by the minute. They refuse deposits without reason,  the are SLOW on processing deposits, and their customer service,  if you can call it that,  it's foreign and not familiar with US banking regulations.\n",
            " - insanely slow at processing checks and deposits.\n",
            " - I really wanted to go with a smaller bank but they couldn't verify my address with insurance bills or toll bills. Does anyone else know what would work?\n",
            " - Over time using Novo Platform. With security issues arriving at the Business account. Contacting support for advice and help to protect against unauthorized behavior. Was noted that the customer service ignored the second petition for protection and/or stop.Conclusion:  The situation was over Novo's expectations related to Banking security and safety protocols for their clients. Alone on my end.Thanks\n",
            " - Novo bank has severely limited features, and as a result it will not support your banking needs. They may promise a modern experience, but what they deliver is a half-baked product with significant gaps that they will not address for years to come.\n",
            " - I started banking with NOVO in September 2021. The adventure has been wonderful. The updates and upgrades are always relevant and valuable. There are several native integrations that makes NOVO a technical powerhouse.If you are a start-up company looking for a place to bank, NOVO is a great choice. You will be amazed at the level of support you receive throughout your journey.Since my original review on July 10th, Bank Novo has added bookkeeping functionalities and tax filing services.\n",
            " - Ever since I signed up the whole NOVO experience has been a breeze. They make sure all my payments go out on time the app is super easy to navigate. They made my PPP application so smooth and I got my funds a few days later and when it came to the forgiveness they sent e-mails reminding me to file and they mad that process smooth too. For as long as I stay in business I’m not switching for my banking needs.\n",
            " - DO NOT USE NOVO!!!!!!! They treat customers like trash. If I could give them 0 stars I would. They make life unnecessarily difficult for small businesses in good standing. WORST BANK EVER. period\n",
            " - Run a business we are very popular. Once they found out we do humanitarian work in Asia and Kenya our application was denied with haste.Our organization has a long standing, we have all or financial and legal documents in order.Didn't matter. Take your business to a more reputable place\n",
            " - Absolutely wonderful bank. Great communication and they are constantly working to innovate.They integrate with multiple apps including Stripe, Square, Shopify, and PayPal, Venmo, Quickbooks, and Freshbooks just to name a few.\n",
            " - wasted 24 hrs in their application process only to learn that they could not verify original CA driver license and LLC company documents. Not sure how a bank can exist if their ability to verify documents is questionable. This was the first organization in US which said they could not verify my CA driver and rejected the application without providing any solid ground on the reason for rejection.\n",
            " - Novobanco in tavira . I did an application for a mortgage loan it took them 3 weeks and asking for all the paperwork all over again to say well we need a grantor and for the90% you need to be portugees. Everyone run from this !!!! i will go now somewhere else where a customer is respected. they are all nice when you come to open bankaccount and want you . Once in nothing\n",
            " - I have been trying for days to get a form filled out that my ach processing company needs. NOTHING! This is holding up thousands of dollars my small business needs to pay bills & payroll!!\n",
            " - It works but primative!! Very everything takes longest time to update realtime wire transfers ; your charges won't appear a realtime balance for hours! This is a online bank that falls under middle Essex federal so any thing you need asap fast you might want to keep changes would be awesome! Waiting eagerly looking!\n",
            " - My experience has been excellent fast response time very helpful and courteous,. I'm happy with Novo Banking ..\n",
            " - I love novo only thing novo needs is the ability to lock your card . When I’m on business trips I like the added security of knowing I can lock my my card if it’s. Lost or stolen\n",
            " - I’m a real estate investor and I thought an online bank would be agile enough for purchases. WRONG. Do not use Novo if you need to move any substantial sums of money. I’ve been fighting for over a week to move MY Money. Buyer beware.\n",
            " - Great place to bank, no surprise fees, simple and safe.\n",
            " - I am so happy XM Radio advertised and I found them.\n",

            " - Had a problem with Novo confirming address but it was resolved\n",
            " - I my account was edited so I was unable to recover itbecause my information didn't match what was on file so they couldn't send me a recover link even after I supplied the all my info when I signed up...I have not been contacted by one of their agents....Cloys Feldman  251.222.0028\n",
            " - Literally the best bank to for all your business banking needs. The app is seamlessly curated to the modern needs of an entrepreneur and everything is just so clean, thorough and concise. The perks/rewards system is super cool and that's not even the half of it. The support system is built into the mobile app so if you're ever having an issue you get to submit a ticket WITHIN THE APP and chat with an agent live ! No more sending emails back and forth that tend to be hours apart like most other banks operate. Do not have second thoughts about joining Novo. This bank is going places and I'm excited for what the future has in store !\n",
            " - I recommend Novo Bank for many reasons. My business is running with Novo. Im very happy with the support!!\n",
            " - NOVO has been awesome to work with since I joined. The application process was easy and thorough. Since The app and website have been user friendly and support has been quick, friendly and resolved my user error. I have recommended to others already and will continue to recommend.\n",
            " - I wish I can talk to rep over the phone  the solutions would be solved much quicker\n",
            " - Novo is awesome and amazing.  Response time for any problems is quick. They show concern. They work with you to resolve the problems.  Consider banking with them it is with it.\n",
            " - I like the concept of this bank, but their customer support is not responsive and they are not able to resolve simple issues with their mobile app.  This is not acceptable for people trying to run a small business.   There is no easy way to call and talk with someone to help with issues.\n",
            " - ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️, Glad to be user of this novo. It is so easy an awesome app that you going to be addicted all day you will check the app. Process for sign up is so easy employees are on top of your email for support. They're all best in privacy it takes three days for approval but it's worth it. Cheers to NoVo\n",
            " - I am a business owner in California, where a 'DBA' is not required for sole proprietors that use their last name in the business name.Novo refuses to accept checks made out to the business because they require DBA filing documents - again, even though Californa expressly does not require such.Support line was wholly unhelpful and rude.Edit: As shown by the clueless response by Novo, they will help acquire documents that the State of California expressly says not to bother obtaining. So a business must jump through hoops to placate the bank.\n",
            " - had an issue with routing #. I got a quick and fast response.\n",
            " - Bank Novo is a wonderful company to use. They are genuine and professional. I've had all great experiences with them thus far.\n",
            " - New to novo but after BAD experiences with Mercury and Bluevine I'm hoping for a good experience here. So far stuff works great with ACH transfers that never worked with Mercury (most bank rejected them and said they won't deal with them). So far all other banks are happy with Novo transfers and payment, YAY!!\n",
            " - Ian rocks.  Thank you for the great support and quick responses, it really helps to be able to run my business and know what I am doing day to day.  Keep up the great work.  Joe at 2110solutions\n",

            " - Good buy. Easy to wash and safe to wear. I want to say I enjoyed owing Hawes & Curtis\n",
            " - Novo is a great bank.  I've been a customer for almost three years now and I am so happy I chose to bank with them.  Support is quick and thoughtful. Things just work.  Their policies are fair.  What more do you want in a bank?\n",
            " - The team here is amazing and will go the extra mile to make sure you are taken care of. Loving the neobanks of the future!\n",
            " - Zero customer support. When you call Member Services you get a voicemail but they never call back. Total sham. I am also reporting to BBB.\n",
            " - I am very disappointed with Novo.. No one to talk to about what has happened to the deposits from sales over Christmas. I opened  a ticket on 12/28 and no one has contacted me, as of yet. At this point, I feel as though Novo Business Banking is a scam and I will no longer have any of my business funds transferred to Novo.\n",
            " - Run. This isn’t a bank. It’s a name acting as a bank. Deposits are a headaches. Support is non existent. It’s for very very very small businesses.\n",
            " - Every experience I've had with Novo has been excellent, which is far more than I can say for my interactions with other big banks. It seems like they really care and they truly strive to deliver a high quality banking experience.\n",
            " - I tried Bluevine for a few months and they were a nightmare. I couldn't be happier since switching to Novo.\n",
            " - Banking with Novo is a breeze.  My experience has been very positive, and I see improvements over what I first thougt was first class service.\n",
            " - I love the facts of no monthly fees, I get my ATM fees back and also I can have several sources to get payments from clients. I love my business account with Novo Bank!\n",
            " - Nothing to say but hassle-free, easy, flawless. Very good to work with, they keep you with info that could help your business.\n",
            " - Another silicon valley organization with a hidden agenda. In order to accumulate personal information you are required to provide them with a huge amount of personal information, including a gov't photo ID. Only to have them deny your application\n",
            " - Novo has been very proactive in making sure I have access to the support that I need to make informed banking decisions for my business. Would (and have) recommend(ed) them to friends and colleagues.\n",
            " - I enjoy Novo. Easy and simple. Doesn’t cost me money.. very user-friendly. I like the layout of the app it is very nice. And I like the immediate email response when needed.\n",
            " - A totally streamlined process for both the loan application and forgiveness. Thank you NOVO.\n",
            " - If you could Live chat I would give it 5 stars.  The messaging/email wastes a lot of time.\n",
            " - As a small business owner there can be so many hurdles. But NOVO has really help to alleviate many concerns and worries I had. The experience has been seamless and I'm looking forward to being a client for a long time.\n",
            " - I have been using this bank for just a few weeks honestly and they have been amazing, Informative, and attentive. I let account sit dormant as a back up plan if you will and I definitely plan to continue to use this bank. ALSO the approval process was much simpler and streamlined than for other online banks that offer the services. Highly recommend truly !!!!! I literally tweeted about them and told all my fellow business owner peers. It’s the best of both worlds the  accessibility Of a “traditional” online with all of the perks of a brick and mortar bank.\n",
            " - Great honest online banking. Fast response and always very helpful. They don’t put their money before their clients and seem very focused on serving their users. Refreshing to deal with Novo.\n",
            " - I’m updating my review to 3-stars.I had a bad experience but Novo worked on it to find a solution a day later.I would say anyone considering Novo, just know what you’re getting into. The upside is speed of set up and low fees, the downside is slow customer service, especially when you have a unique problem.\n",
            " - Easy to work with and connecting accounts following your account via their application, support team doesn’t leave you hanging, my cellular signal lost connection, the NOVO team reached to me a few times and we picked up right where we left off at.\n",
            " - I received the first draft of the PPP loan in May 2020. The entire process was quick and easy. I submitted my loan forgiveness app inSep 2020, which I was expecting to be complicated, but it wasn't. The format was super user friendly and I  completed it in a matter of minutes. I received an email today saying that the SBA approved my application and that my PPP loan was all forgiven. Great experience from being to end.\n",
            " - very extraordinary bank thank you for your efforts ooh rah\n",
            " - USE THEM AS A LAST RESORT ONLY!!!!Has to be one of the worst banking experiences I’ve ever had!!!They hold your direct deposits and DON’T allow them to post right away like other financial institutions. If you’ve got absolutely no other choice I understand. USE THEM AS A LAST RESORT ONLY!!!!\n",
            " - Novo Bank Is the only Bank that truly looks for my business interest.\n",
            " - Only used the app for a month but so far good for depositing checks paying bills and transferring money\n",
            " - Didn't even know my consultancy business was eligible for a PPP loan. Novo reached out, advised me and led me through the process. They also followed up when it was time to apply for loan forgiveness.\n",
            " - Very good banking  experienceI enjoy the user-friendly experience as well as the sleek design.\n",
            " - Great banking , a few delays here and there. But overall pretty good.\n",
            " - Only \"invited\" reviews are 5 stars... real customers 0 stars!Worst experience! Restricts access cards never come.. no customer service! Can't get my money! No one has answers! Do not trust!  Read only non-\"invited\" on trustpilot!Novo is a scam Shame class action coming soon! Will be gone like azlo and other banks!\n",
            " - I had $300 worth of fraudulent charges (in a stat I am nowhere near) and they won’t return my money. It’s a constant run around to get the the “right” department. Total joke!\n",
            " - Novo has given me the tools I need that other banks wouldn't offer.  Consistent and valuable service, super fast transaction information, awesome app and website, I have had nothing but a good experience so far.\n",
            " - Novo made the process extremely easy to understand and complete. Novo sent reminders to help me stay on top of my business.\n",
            " - The entire PPP loan process with Novo was quick and painless. They made the application phase easy as well as the follow-up and loan forgiveness process. I am so happy that I chose Novo for my business banking as well as PPP loan.\n",
            " - I absolutely love Novo. They make running my business easy with the option for reserves so I can manually separate out my money into categories!\n",
            " - With multiple businesses, there was absolutely no way I’d be able to handle the PPP loan application from start to finish. I made a mistake and put the wrong EIN number for the wrong business. After a slight panic I received a call from the bank and said they will straighten it out. Novo Bank was perfectly set up. Then I received the forgiveness email and realized how simple it was to complete. In less than a week I received full forgiveness. Online banking is very new for me and now I realize how much convenient and trust I have in their process. So glad! Thank you very much!!!\n",
            " - Thank you Novo for bringing PPP Loan options to my attention.  I never would have considered it or applied otherwise. The entire process was about as quick and easy as it gets.\n",
            " - I absolutely love Bank Novo. As an entrepreneur and sole proprietor, I want a bank that is easy, not complicated. I already work hard on my business, so I don't want a bunch of hurdles and hoops to jump through just to keep track of my income and expenses. Bank Novo is perfect. And it's free, without all the fluff and BS that comes with bigger banks. Plus, they continuously upgrade with features that I need and love while also ensuring that their level of support is still customer-focused.\n",
            " - I added Novo as a secondary bank account for my small business a few months ago, mainly so I could do ACH transfers for clients without incurring lots of fees and limits. Their team is very helpful and respond very promptly to support inquiries with flexible solutions.\n",
            " - I absolutely love banking with Novo. I love the app and it's fun little animations. I absolutely love talking to any of the team members if I have an issue. I've liturally never chatted to anyone who wasn't absolutely lovely! They listen and ask if you have thoughts or suggestions on what can be improved or changed with the app. Couldn't recommend highly enough!\n",
            " - NOVO is the best solution for all busy people. Fast, easy and simple way to have your business money save\n",
            " - I am loving the simplicity of the app and process I’d getting my business banking account. I am recommending to all my friends and family who have LLC’s etc!\n",
            " - I recently applied for a small business account with NOVO. They denied me for a unknown reason.  I am a Black Owned disabled Veteran business.  I am not sure why they turned me down.  I met all the qualifications.  I believe this bank does not support Black owned Veteran business.\n",
            " - Helped me get my ppp loan easily! And loan forgiven! Love this bank so much\n",
            " - Attempted to sign up which was pretty easy. But two days later received an email stating I was denied. I have perfect credit, strong financials, and my business is straight forward (mortgage broker). No specific explanation. No big deal, I went to a local credit union. Probably a better decision.\n",
            " - Novo helped my company with the PPP loan process. They were very professional and made things very clear.We were given a personal representative who helped us through the entire process. An amazing company with amazing people.\n",
            " - Everyone is super helpful, kind, and knowledgeable.\n",
            " - Bank Novo has been great, because of me being an account holder. Bank Novo notified me about the PPP loan. I received the loan directly to my Novo business account, then they notified me when it was time to apply for the loan forgiveness. My loan was forgiven and Novo processed everything.Awesome!!\n",
            " - I switched from Azlo to Novo when Azlo closed. Novo has been a fantastic experience, very user friendly, responsive, really a great banking experience overall.\n",
            " - I love Novo. As a small business, Novo has helped me manage my money and find loans flawlessly. It has immensely helped me be more productive and grow my business. I'm extremely thankful.\n",
            " - Novo gave my business the opportunity and I am ever grateful.\n",
            " - Very thorough and resourceful bank, super helpful\n",
            " - I love NOVO!  Why?  No fees.\n",
            " - Novo has made banking so easy & efficient. I thought Novo convenience would end at “easy banking,” but they also actively look out for their costumers. They sent me notices for SBA loans when my business met the requirements. Then, they helped me get a loan by sending me easy, electronic forms to fill out…and then, they helped me get loan forgiveness. Amazing experience so far.\n",
            " - Extremely unhappy that I am unable to download a .qbo file to use in QuickBooks. Novo's integration with QBO rarely works correctly and duplicates transactions frequently.  I can't deal with it and no other option is provided.  With so many small businesses using QBO or even desktop QuickBooks, I am disappointed that a company who purports to be innovators in business banking can't make this work.\n",
            " - Novo went out of their way to make sure I applied for the PPP loan, like OUT OF THEIR WAY. I got $10,000 for free because of their diligence and customer care. Will be a lifelong user because everything else is just icing on the cake. Love their integrations, no-hassle banking, and anything else they continuously add to their platform. So happy to use Novo for my business :)\n",
            " - Absolutely amazing turn around! Good communication as well…\n",
            " - I love how Novo operates. It is much better then Alzo. Glad is was offered the chance to switch my account.\n",
            " - Novo is a great business bank!  I have been to the brick and mortar banks for my business in the past but in todays agile marketplace you need agile banks that are there to help....Novo is that bank for me.  Questions - they have answers to your issues and solutions to your problems.\n",
            " - This was a very quick and easy process.  I really appreciated the reminders to apply for forgiveness.  I was not expecting a reply so soon.\n",
            " - Great support. Especially in times of need.\n",
            " - Novo has awesome integrations, very user-friendly platforms, and feels very safe.  All of my interactions have been very positive!\n",
            " - I have been very impressed with Novo after switching over from Azlo (once that bank closed).  I had no desire to use a local business bank. It was so easy to sign up especially during off hours. Who has time to go to the bank. My only complaint is that It doesn’t seem to work with PayPal.\n",
            " - They were very helpful with SBA loan.  Good communication from Novo.\n",
            " - Bank Novo help with my PPP loan when I'm pretty sure no other bank would even talk to me. They let me know when it was tome yo submit the forgiveness application. Novo helped me all through the process with a very pleasant and professional manner. Great bank to be with\n",
            " - Novo identified my small business as a potential loan recipient. They worked hard to help me get approved and with the proper paperwork. The whole process was online and very streamlined. I received my loan disbursement very quickly. Eventually, I was contacted by Novo that my loan might be eligible for total forgiveness. Again, their online, seamless process helped my application with the SBA get approval and my loan was forgiven! Thanks, Novo for helping my business get the funding it needed to help it through these weird times. Much appreciated.\n",
            " - Great job guiding me through the PPP loan application and forgiveness process. Other companies made it quite confusing to understand but Nova made it quick and easy!\n",
            " - Your service and communication are just outstanding! Thank you for helping us every step of the way.\n",
            " - Easy online banking for businesses and they helped me get a PPP too! Some snags in the beginning with connecting my personal account but after that it's been smooth sailing.\n",
            " - Novo helped me get my PPP Loans without any issues, and I had my money quickly. The process to get them forgiven was quick and easy, and with a week, I was notified they were forgiven.\n",
            " - Very helpful team and excellent digital interface. Thank you!\n",
            " - Novo is awesome!!! They basically saved my life, literally... The ease, and assistance with the PPP loan they offered was Great!!

            " - This process was very quick and painless.  I am very grateful for Novo.\n",
            " - Love the features and the product.  It's the perfect business banking for the sole proprietorship, freelancer, consultant, etc.\n",
            " - Listen! I love Novo. I couldn’t ask for a better business bank provider. From when I opened my account to now they have been awesome!\n",
            " - When Azlo announced they were closing suddenly I didn’t know what I was going to do , but I’m so glad that I chose Novo for my business banking ! The transition was super smooth and the app offers so much and it’s convenient . Thank for everything Novo\n",
            " - Novo was right there with me every step of the way with my PPP loan. I didn't even think we'd qualify, but they made the process so easy. The funding kept my business afloat and I am forever grateful.\n",
            " - Novo has honestly been the bank of my dreams since I signed up earlier this year! As a solo entrepreneur, I needed something easy yet robust. They have been extremely responsive with all matters and I could not be happier.\n",
            " - I’ve transferred to Novo from Azlo since their closing and so far I have received the same level of good services. They helped me apply for the PPP loan, and the forgiveness. I really like this bank for small businesses\n",
            " - I have been banking with NOVO for a few months and I absolutely love the interface and ease of the online banking. I recently had to update my name to my new married name. The process felt seamless and it didn't feel like I was talking to a robot or anything. They made it easy and the communication and process was fast. Thank you! I plan to continue using NOVO for all business banking.\n",
            " - Everything was very simple and straightforward\n",
            " - I'm relatively new to Bank Novo, having moved from Azlo.  I like these tech online banks.  So far, so good.  I had my first customer support experience, with an odd \"Something went wrong!\" message that was blocking access to my data after successful login.  The online support-tab model worked well--no waiting, rapid response, good suggestions, problem solved.\n",
            " - Happy Novo client. Love that it offers additional services and integrations not provided by other banks.\n",
            " - Novo has been everything they said it would be.  Easy, accessible and inexpensive online banking.  It ties directly to my Quickbooks and Wise allowing me to pay overseas contractors and quickly record all transactions in my books.\n",
            " - IMO Novo is the best neobank, especially for digital-first businesses. Azlo held this title before they closed, and Mercury is probably a close second, but better for startup owners than digital services providers. Novo is great because of its simplicity and integration with other modern tools like Stripe, Square, and Wave Accounting. The best hidden feature is that they don't charge for ACH Invoices — everywhere else does, including Stripe. So if you're okay with a slightly less functional invoice page, use Novo, and you get your funds quicker and without a fee.\n",
            " - Novo has been a wonderful bank account to start my business, and I love the reserves feature (where you can set money aside and designate it for a purpose) - this has helped me save for taxes.\n",
            " - Very patient and understanding in my stumbling and bumping with my start-up. Novo bank is very prompt when responding to issues, questions, or problems when and if I have them. I am definitely fortunate and happy looking back on this year and approaching the 4th quarter of 2021 that Novo is my first business bank.\n",
            " - I love Novo! I love how I can create multiple accounts (savings funds) within my account. I use ProfitFirst accounting and this is just perfect for me. It is exactly what I needed! I love Novo bank!\n",
            " - I love using Novo! It works really well for my business and using the Profit First model is easy using multiple reserves. I love keeping my money in one place and organized.\n",
            " - Overall Im happy with Novo but it is pretty simplistic and I hope that there will be major updates in the future.\n",
            " - It's very convenient to manage funds, easy interface. The only disadvantage the transfer takes about 3 days.\n",
            " - Novo has been a great bank to work with. Everything has been incredibly smooth and support have been top-notch when needed.\n",
            " - Novo is a wonderful bank! Love everything about it.\n",
            " - We had an Azlo account for our small business. It did what we needed it to do, but was pretty limited as far as reporting. It was a pain to have to switch banks, but we've been very pleased with Novo. It's much easier to make payments and run reports for monthly sales tax purposes.\n",
            " - I really love banking with Novo! The perks and how it works really makes things simple.\n",
            " - The best online bank with the least fees and low required deposit…enjoying these features thus far and will recommend to associates.\n",
            " - I'm always treated w the utmost respect Although normally checking on my account can\n",
            " - I needed a free business banking option but not the locations. My personal banking is with USAA and the customer service I receive from Novo is just as stellar. Easy website navigation and analytics dashboard adds even more value to an already free account. I write reviews for a living, but this one is not sponsored.\n",
            " - I am a sole proprietor paying an assistant for helping me out for a few hours a week. With Novo, I can easily make a direct deposit to my assistant's account with a few clicks of a button.\n",
            " - The Novo service is just what I need as a small business owner, doing my own accounting, not making huge margins.Though not as robust as other invoicing platforms, it's cool you can even invoice directly from their platform. I wish I could share invoices via a link, save items, save templates and add a logo, but hey, this is not their main business, its cool they even have it at all.\n",
            " - I've been using Novo bank for about a month now and have had all positive experiences!\n",
            " - I am really enjoying Novo Online banking - Did my research and gave them an go.  It was easy to add my business info although they had security measures that I had no problem providing them with the requested info.  On top of my banking needs being met the perks are also great.  All in all I am pleased!\n",
            " - A free, minimalist bank that has great features. I started my own consulting business and Novo provided what I needed with little hassle.\n",
            " - Already reviewed. It keeps bugging me to.\n",
            " - Novo is a great bank for my new business. I greatly appreciate the mobile app and all the controls I have.  I do not miss having a local bank branch at all with Novo!\n",
            " - We recently switched to Novo and so far it's been great. We particularly like that it has reserve \"envelopes\" for us to set aside savings.\n",
            " - So it’s been Two months and nothing but Bliss! They are amazing I love novo✅✅\n",
            " - Just trying to remove this Trust pilot popup.\n",
            " - Complete 1diots! I went to change the name of my business with Novo and they said I didn't have the write documentation. I am a business law attorney...I think I know how these things work.\n",
            " - Quick and easy way to pay your bills from phone or computer.\n",
            " - Simple and smart business banking app. Perfect for solopreneurs like me! The paper check feature is also pretty cool.\n",
            " - The mobile app, which is the only efficient way to deposit hard copy checks, does not “recognize” checks issued by the State of California. So you’ll have to mail them in. Not good, if like me, you pay taxes here.  Looking for another banking option….\n",
            " - Ive loved my experience with Novo in general for the past months.\n",
            " - When I found Novo, I was very unhappy with all the other business banking solutions I had tried. The previous ones I tried had some combination of ridiculous fees, terrible user experience for their online/app interface, or just didn't have the features I needed to run my business. Novo gave me everything I needed, and I am very happy with the online banking experience.\n",
            " - I switched over after Azlo closed. Novo's clean interface and ease of sending contractor payments is key to keeping my business running.\n",
            " - Great company. Wish I could take out more\n",
            " - They have monthly limit of 50k and 120 transactions. They did not say it anywhere until I reach to the limit and when I asked them to raise it, they said they won't. What?\n",
            " - Simple yet functionalThe web interface is intuitive and you may customize it to suit your needs.\n",
            " - Simple, secure, everything I need as a freelancer.\n",
            " - This bank works great. Very happy.\n",
            " - Free. Fast. Simple. Great integrations, and really nice rewards / perks at signup. We'll be using Novo exclusively for our business banking alongside Brex Credit, Lili, MoneyLion, Revolut Metal, Cash App, Venmo, Chime, OnJuno, and cred.ai – all great accounts with various different benefits and drawbacks. Keep up the great work! – DJ AFINO\n",
            " - Since the fall of the US Postal System, ACH transfer has become our only method of paying bills. I find it daunting that the NOVObank limits your spending to $5K a day. It's YOUR money. I have brought this up on several occasions only to fall on deaf ears. I am now searching for a bank that won't limit us on how (and when) we use ACH. I am disappointed.\n",
            " - East to use. Beautiful UI. Geared towards small businesses.\n",
            " - Everything works as advertised.  I'm pretty quick to get annoyed and they haven't annoyed me yet.  Keep up the great work!\n",
            " - Novo bank has been nothing short of spectacular with its service and functionalities.\n",
            " - This is a different kind of bank. Starting a business is much easier with Novo, a bank with fair fees and lots of features.\n",
            " - Banking with Novo makes me feel a part of the team. I send inquiries at my convenience and receive timely response that take my worries away.\n",
            " - Man love this hidden Gem of a Bank. Highly recommend it for personal and business purposes. Simply Love it.\n",
            " - My business switched over to Novo after a bad experience with another \"startup bank\" (Wise). I am SO glad we made the switch. Novo is easy to work with and has all of the features my company needs for growing and scaling.\n",
            " - I like it, the only thing I wish they would fix is the $2000 limit in transfers\n",
            " - I really appreciate how simple Novo makes it for me as a busy business owner. The UI is great and they're very kind to interact with!  Especially appreciate no ATM fees!\n",
            " - Bank Novo is an awesome banking solution. They are very interactive and helpful when any issues arise.\n",
            " - I really like how all the features work so easily, but it is still new so there are some critical ones that are missing. Honestly it has been a great experience, everything works so well, I have two companies I have responsibility for and I moved both to Novo. The features it does have are just well designed and smooth like they should be, you'll wonder what your bank has been doing all these years. Can I just get some scheduled payments at least tho? Just a few more features and you'll never consider another biz banking solution.\n",
            " - I have been using NOVO for my business bank account for about 6 months now and I am very happy with it. I love that I can do everything within the app. I send my invoices, receive payment, set aside funds for taxes and other business expenses, and it is so easy to use. The only drawback is that when invoicing it does not remember my client information so I have to enter it each time, but for everything else it does, that is a small inconvenience.\n",
            " - I've been very happy with Novo. This is the online back I chose for my new small business. I know it's gonna get even better and I'm happy to be part of that journey.\n",
            " - Novo Bank took on my business when Azlo was closing with no issues or hardships with setting things up.  Everything has been transparent and easy :). Thanks Novo!!!!!!\n",
            " - Novo is a simple, easy, and well-designed online business banking app! We trust Novo to make payouts to employees, reserve money, and create invoices!\n",
            " - Novo bank was the only bank to help me through PPP round 2. While communication through that was sketchy it was far better than other banks I had tried. I have moved my business from Wells Fargo to Novo Bank and I don't miss a thing! The online interface is easy to use. Direct Pay for payroll is a breeze (and it's free!). They increased my daily transfer limit the same day I asked. I'm a happy customer.\n",
            " - Novo gave me a week's notice and is closing my account. I provide education/training to individuals about how they can invest in digital assets (cryptocurriencies), and I am clear (with both Novo and my clients) that I do not provide financial nor tax advice. Novo said their underlying bank considers my business \"an unsupported type\" (likely due to the crypto aspect). This is huge inconvenience to have to find another bank after going through the steps of providing all of the documentation that Novo required to open my business account in the first place. Their website/integrations appear to be great and very useful, but their unwillingness to work with me leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.\n",
            " - I switched to Novo after getting sick of paying fees and worrying about minimum balances for my small business. I could not be happier with the ease of use in terms of setting up the account, depositing funds, transfers to other accounts, and of course NO FEES OR MINIMUM BALANCE. Notifications and emails keep me up to date on features and use of the account. I have already recommended Novo to several colleagues. This is what banking should be in the digital age. Wish that Novo had personal accounts as well.\n",
            " - Been using the bank for both my businesses. The site and app are easy to use. I like the benefits like ATM fees being covered and the integrations that are offered (integrations like QuickBooks are great). My only concern is mobile deposit processing time which can sometimes take over a week to process a check when my other bank is doing it in 2-3 days.\n",
            " - Best banking experience I've ever experienced. Their customer support has no compare in my opinion. Most company support are horrible at best. Novo is the go-to bank for business in my opinion\n",
            " - We're a tiny firm that's just getting started, so I appreciate not having to pay fees for everything just yet. I've been using it for about a month now. Transactions are simple and quick, and I appreciate that they are compatible with Square.\n",
            " - I LOVE NOVO! It literally allows me to do anything and everything I need to manage my biz funds!\n",
            " - Loving Novo Bank, I have had a great experience so far.\n",
            " - I appreciate the fee free option giving us ability to deposit multiple checks per month.  However there is a much longer wait for deposits to clear than AZLO and mobile deposits take extra steps which are both negative.  I also wish the activity was clearer.  Deposits show there as if they've been cleared and deposited but they're not.  They should show those that are still pending as pending and what date it should clear.  And it would be nice to have a running balance so it would be easier to compare with balances on home page.\n",
            " - Have been using about a month. We are a small business just starting so I love not having to pay fees for every little thing when we don't yet have much profit. Transactions are quick and easy to make, and I like the compatibility with Quickbooks and Square.\n",
            " - Awsome. Fast easy....just a lil delay on the time but ok\n",
            " - I like that I can do my business banking all from home and that Novo helps me keep track of my pay-outs and income via the visual graphs!\n",
            " - Payment processed without any issues.Have never had any issues in processing payments. Great feature that a payee can be added and processed at the same time.\n",
            " - This bank is the best i have ever banked with. Its operation is so easy to navigate around. Support team is the best ever. Prompt response.\n",
            " - Solid online banking experience. Simple ACH interface.\n",
            " - I have been using Novo for few months now. Money transfers, checks and ACH are totally free and work smoothly. I am very pleased!!\n",
            " - Clunky Interface, no automatic payment option.\n",
            " - Unable to transact business properly due to very low limits imposed on business accounts. Continually having to reach out to customer service for limit extensions on deposits and payments; not effective for running a business.\n",
            " - Excellent no-fee banking services with tons of features! I've been very impressed with the quality of Novo.\n",
            " - ACH payments take a really long timeWebsite is not intuitiveWhen I make an ACH payment sometimes it does it twice\n",
            " - I like that it's all just a quick click away from doing so many important bank matters. Of course, it works really well on my cell phone, too.\n",
            " - Great bank, still working out the kinks on a few things, but otherwise totally serviceable and accessible.\n",
            " - Great product, available 24/7/365.\n",
            " - First, this \"technology\" company doesn't have the ability to show a running balance with each transaction on their app or website. Really?Second, they are extremely particular about how you must endorse a check to deposit via their mobile app -- but asking them HOW to do that is like asking them for the CEO's home address. Good luck, because they'll return your deposit if you didn't endorse it exactly how they want it.\n",
            " - I love the UI of Novo and how simple it is to maneuver around. Very user friendly and so far everything has been great! Had no issues after using it for a month, but we will see how it goes in the next few months!\n",
            " - Very smooth to set up ACH transfer payments to employees and vendors.\n",
            " - The $5,000 daily limit for ACH's is frustrating!!\n",
            " - Very experienced and efficient help with navigating the new interface; truly impressed with the experience so far.\n",
            " - Transactions are unclear because there is no running balance. This makes in impossible to properly reconcile your transactions in Quickbooks. It is also very easy to double link your Quickbooks account and get double transaction records.\n",
            " - No hassle and easy to work with unlike a similar competitor like Bluevine. Bluevine really sucks compared to Novo. Novo's third party check service works perfectly. Bluvine was never been successful so I gave it up. Bluevine froze my account due to missing documents. Yes. They deactivated my business checking account all of a sudden causing a lot of problems to my business because of stupid documents. They even required a copy of my SSC. What the hell? Use Novo. Period!\n",
            " - Novo is very simple to use which I enjoy that for my business. The only thing I would add is a instant transfer for internal users.\n",
            " - The platform is very straightforward.  As a user for only a few months, I have already seen several upgrades/improvements.  Transfer limits are relatively low and have inconsistent timelines.\n",
            " - The whole process has been smooth sailing thus far. I use this bank and another to handle transactions. It’s a no brained good bank!\n",
            " - Good account for small businesses. Everything is intuitively laid out, and we've had no issues with billing, invoicing, or tracking expenses. The integration with Stripe and Wave is nice too. The only thing I'd like to see is the ability to manage multiple accounts (for multiple businesses) with one login\n",
            " - I like Novo. Good support, great software, it works, what more do you need! Only downside they dont offer wire transfers... which is a bummer.\n",
            " - Fantastic! Even refund my ATM fees. Love Novo!\n",
            " - Bank Novo is my first experience with a fully virtual bank, so I was nervous at first, but it has turned out to be amazing and I wish I had done it sooner. The site is super user friendly and straight forward, I've never had problems finding info or navigating it. I can take out cash from any ATM & get refunded for atm charges. Bank transfers/payment have all been less than the 2-3 days they state, and is usually in my other bank in less than 24 hrs! They also have great customer service, they are prompt, thorough, and friendly. I'm very happy that I chose bank Novo for my basic business needs.\n",
            " - I just love NOVO bank.  I have been using them for just under one month and I have ZERO complaints.  I have needed support a few times and they are always very responsive.\n",
            " - Best Bank & Banking App I've ever used.After agonizing research locally and online, my HUSBAND found NOVO for my business banking. Not only is it FREE. It's the best experience, customer service wise, ease of desktop website and ease of the mobile app of any other bank I've used.\n",
            " - I've never loved a bank until I met Novo, seriously!\n",
            " - Ever since Azlo closed, Novo has been a dream\n",
            " - Good value for free services.\n",
            " - I did not have any issues with this app. It worked as expected.\n",
            " - I switched over from Azlo. So far so good. Novo has been working well for me. I'm pleased with it. Thank you.\n",
            " - Very simple to use, clean interface, no fees. Looking forward to using the reserves feature.\n",
            " - Novo has been perfect for my business. Easily transferring funds to contractors, the reserves are awesome and it syncs with my accounting software super easily.Would highly recommend it!\n",
            " - Easy, clean, supports Profit First accounting\n",
            " - The down side is the bank is indeed completely mobile. If you have an issue you cant verbally speak with anyone via phone. However, in lieu of no verbal conversations, the customer service team makes every effort to respond to issues quickly.\n",
            " - Simple and intuitive. I appreciate the in-platform invoicing.\n",
            " - Easy bank to work with and set up for my business. Refunds crazy ATM fees monthly so can use any ATM. Let's me pay bills easily and flexibly.\n",
            " - Novo has a youthful Robinhood.com-esque feel to it. Well tuned to small companies particularly with eCommerce aspirations.However, I am using them more traditionally as replacement for Bank of America account - I still need to receive and send checks. Support was able to quickly up my per-check limit to match my needs as a business.\n",
            " - I really like Bank Novo. It does everything I want and is simple to use. No confusing layouts and nothing feels like it's trying to trap me.\n",
            " - Novo has a great look and it has the potential to be a great online payment platform. However, we need to pay a lot of people via direct deposit and the UX for this is quite atrocious. We have to go through 7 screens to do 1 direct deposit. Come on! On top of this, everytime, we must re-enter the password for the account. Really really bad. Please fix. Note: We came over from azlo which was great, but we would have gotten another account had we known all this. Sorry, it's the truth!Also, the app does not refresh on the Dashboard page. I have to close the app and then reopen to see the balance.\n",
            " - I've been enjoying Novo's ease of use and functionality. SO glad I didn't opt for a big-box bank for my new business account.\n",
            " - The back services are excellent.  I am in Seattle and want an out of state bank for my property transactions where wiring funds is needed.\n",
            " - Switched to Novo after my old online small business bank (Azlo) shut down. Lots of similar features, and honestly a bit snappier on the interface.\n",
            " - We are an eCommerce business and LOVE the ease of doing all of our banking online. The integrations are great and the ease of use is awesome! We look forward to even more updates and improvements.\n",
            " - So effectively affectivez works great for me eveeytomdu\n",
            " - Does what I need it to, but slow in making deposits available.\n",
            " - This is banking made easy! I did not score a 5 because my clients often pay via e-check and I am not able to deposit them here. I look forward to when that too is an option.\n",
            " - Bank Novo has been so user-friendly and delightful that I've now got 2 accounts with them for my 2 different businesses. I really love the interface and have had no issues!\n",
            " - Novo is a legitimate and wonderful bank for small business owners. My favorite feature is invoicing. You'll be able to send invoices directly in the bank app for free.\n",
            " - I have used internet banks in the past, but was ultimately dissatisfied with the services. Bank Novo has developed a platform and user experience that is top notch. It's easy to find what I'm looking for because of their excellent design, but they also gave me the ability to rearrange my dashboard to suit my personal needs.\n",
            " - Novo is a convenient way to do business but not having access to customer support is a real problem.  Depositing larger checks or being able to pay invoices for more than $5,000 is problematic.  The popup for this survey happened when I paid an invoice.  The invoice was paid, the popup came up, I cancelled it, and then it brought me back to the submit page as if the invoice was never paid.  I almost paid the invoice twice\n",
            " - Its a great way to manage expenses!\n",
            " - Great bank for startups. My only complaint is i wish they paid interest on cash. Like Goldman Marcus but for small co's.\n",
            " - Novo has been great with my migration from another bank. Their response time is quick, and they listen to my needs and concerns. I'm very happy with my experience thus far.\n",
            " - Easy and convenient with a beautiful and seamless user experience - I LOVE THIS BANK\n",
            " - We've been using Novo for about 6 months and it meets all of our needs.  Can send checks to vendors, pay in-house staff and it's easy to deposit checks via the mobile app.  Recommend to anyone looking for a non-traditional bank.\n",
            " - This a great bank would refer it to a friend!!!\n",
            " - I love this bank! Online Banking is the BEST and their \"Reserve Folders\" let you move client deposit funds, etc, into a named folder thereby removing those funds from the available funds in the main account! Awesome! No Monthly FEES!\n",
            " - Great experience since switching from AZLO.Very user friendly!\n",
            " - good bank, good replacement for Azlo business banking\n",
            " - I absolutely love this company and the banking options available threw them ! I couldn't ask for a better place to do business with for my company !\n",
            " - Our experience with Novo thus far has been awesome! I love that I can customize our dashboard so we are seeing the most important information to us, first. Transfers and transactions have been quick to process too which is great.\n",
            " - I signed up for Novo online which made it convenient as I had all of my documents already handy on my computer and didn't have to worry about printing anything.  The approval process was quick and the app is really easy to use.  There is no minimum balance which really helps during the start-up phase of this company where we currently see more money going out than coming in... Very satisfied with this experience with Novo and highly recommend this for small businesses or companies in the early stages.\n",
            " - One thing that is important to me is being able to speak with a live person immediately and being able to get answers and resolve issues in REAL TIME. Novo has a phone number for customers however they rarely answer it and prefer communicating via text. I came to Novo from Azlo and I must say I truly miss Azlo. Novo has a long way to go to reach where azlo was and they should start with a better customer service communication platform. The biggest thing I noticed from the start was when I spoke to the reps at Azlo they were really nice caring people that actually seemed to Love their jobs. Novo makes me feel like just another person on the list reminds me of a bank of america type bank.\n",
            " - Novo has giving me the prefect experience. So many different options and ways to do whatever u need to do\n",
            " - They helped me out sufficiently. I like their platform and interface\n",
            " - I have been with Novo Banking for a month now, and I can honestly say that I receive excellent customer service via email providing me with updates for my account and friendly reminders about the availability of upcoming deposits and third party payments via PayPal, Square, or Stripe. It has been a seamless integration.Thank you Novo Bank!!\n",
            " - I am happy with what Novo is building. They are offering a great banking solution that has streamlined the way that I do business. They have the necessary integrations to keep my business flexible and offer built-in invoicing. There are areas that they can improve but they are working on it. I am glad to have found them. They offer a solution that is better than anything else out there. Now lets hope they don't go the way of Azlo.\n",
            " - Yikes! Avoid!Traditional banks are terrible... but Novo has proven that online banks can be just as terrible.\"Reply from NovoAn hour agoHi there, thank you for your review! We'd love to hear about what we can do better for you. Please reach out to via the support tab of your app so that we can see if we can resolve anything for you!\"Uh... - your app - and your support is the problem to begin with. How will \"using our broken system\" help?\n",
            " - I have enjoyed my transition from Alzo to Novo. Novo created a seamless move and provided tools to keep you on track with your business expenses. I am very happy with the product\n",
            " - Absolutely love Novo! I had Azlo and initially switched to Bluevine. It was awful, my contractors never got their pay on time, it was just always something. So glad I switched to Novo! You guys are the best! Thank you!!\n",
            " - Came to Novo from Azlo, and overall very happy with everything so far.\n",
            " - I was an Azlo customer and felt so lost when I had to start looking for another business checking account. Novo has been the perfect solution and gave me a seamless transition for my business!\n",
            " - Well designed experience, great support, lots of integrations and seems like they are working to keep adding to and updating the product with more features every day (which I love). It has everything I need from a business account with a few more features that are really helpful. The Stripe payment tracker integrated into the account dashboard is a super smart user feature and one example of what I love about my account. And the bank card is slick :-)\n",
            " - I've come to really like Novo after accepting the loss of Azlo. It's customer friendly, mobil app is fast and so far all positive dealings!\n",
            " - I had been a happy AZLO customer for a couple years and I was blindsided to hear they were shutting down. I just started my own electrical contracting business and things were picking up. Frantically I scoured the web for something comparable to the function and level of customer service AZLO had provided. I ping ponged between a couple other banks and finally found NOVO. I moved my finances around again and have been very happy so far. I know it’s a young bank, but if they can grow in positive direction, they’ll surely earn those shiny five starts I just ticked off. Here’s to us.\n",
            " - I had to quickly find a replacement for Azlo Bank when they closed and the treatment, customer support and whole process was easy and comfortable.  I am excited to grow with them and see the new integrations coming down the road.\n",
            " - So far this bank has been pretty outstanding.I’ve been a member now for about 2 months. The App is fun to use, really well done, and I’ve not had problems to warrant customer service to be able to judge quality, but I’m sure they’d be spot on. I miss some features of my previous bank like the envelopes and instant transfers but overall I’d totally recommend for a small business.\n",
            " - Had Azlo and now I have Novo.  My life got easier.\n",
            " - I switch to Novo to handle payments and receipts for my LLC side hustle.  I had previously been with AZLO and was blown away by how simple they had made business banking - Turns out Novo was even easier to work with than Azlo with integrations into my accounting software and payment provider that Azlo didn't even offer.  Furthermore switching was painless and, dare I say, a joy.\n",
            " - Nice business bank hope this bank stay with me to make millions\n",
            " - They don’t give Nobel prizes for banking apps, and that’s a shame. Because if they did, Novo would win. Novo is the banking app that makes all other banking apps look like toilet torpedoes. In my life as a banking app user, I don’t think anything has mattered more\n",
            " - NOVO jumped in immediately and welcomed the AZLO refugees.  The transition was instantly smooth and familiar.  Great Group here! I'm in it to the end.\n",
            " - I am very satisfied with Novo bank. Multiple integrations. Seamless.\n",
            " - I'm loving Novo!I'm a former Azlo customer, so when Azlo shut down I was quite bummed - and stuck looking for a suitable replacement. I tried Axos to start - they contacted me on Twitter, and they were listed on multiple articles as an \"Azlo replacement.\" It was... tragically bad. Honestly. If you were used to Azlo, it was a huge set back, and a huge waste of time. Novo does everything Azlo did and more. I hope they stick around for many years to come!\n",
            " - Awesome team. Simple to use platform. Offers a seamless experience to meet my needs as a business owner\n",
            " - I had to switch from Azlo when they closed down and Novo has met the needs of my business. I'm thankful for their service and being there to help my business grow!\n",
            " - I was an Azlo client looking for a similar option and got to NOVO. I am truly satisfied, it works almost perfectly with all my company needs and integrations. Looking forward ro have Zelle introduced soon in the account.\n",
            " - I appreciate Novo bank for my business bank. Its simple to use and provides me with everything I need to run my Mobile Notary and Loan Signing Agent Business.\n",
            " - I opened this Business Banking account with ease. Verifying the information was simple and getting it started wasn't a hassle.\n",
            " - Very hard to logon if you do not have cell service, actually impossible sometimes.  That makes it unreliable.  Without cell service You cannot get the code required. Contacting them is difficult!  Very. I thought this would be a good solution, although it took mountains to set it up because they could not get over some of their misinformation no matter how many times I gave them the correct information verified by the government.  It is too much dealing I guess with computers and not enough with a person who can actually reason.\n",
            " - Awesome experience with Novo. Check them out well worth the look.\n",
            " - I love this...the smooth transition from one account to another is sweet! The professional way I am treated and added features on app and site. This has been a great experience for my online business so far. Keep up the good work.\n",
            " - My former bank Azlo closed without a real explanation. I loved Azlo and was praying I could find a new online bank with similar features (or better). Novo made it easy for my business to transition seamlessly. So far so good!\n",
            " - I want every small business owner and regular person to know that Novo is the best online bank. I had opened an account originally with Radius now Lending Club and they were garbage. The only reason I started with Radius was so I can send invoices online via autobooks. Over a month and they haven't been able to resolve the issue. Radius customer services says it's autobooks and they say it's Radius. I even had Lending Clubs product lead John Marinelli (jmarinelli @ lendingclub.com) email me and spoke to me over the phone and he never contacted me again. I felt they did the old fashioned bait and switch or fraudulent advertising. So I joined Novo and on my first day I sent an invoice. Everything they advertise is accurate, efficient, and user friendly. I hope everyone know this is a bank that's here to help, because they sure have helped me.\n",
            " - I like how accessible the bank is. I like the way they send out checks.\n",
            " - No complaints with the service as Novo serves as part of the foundation of my burgeoning business. No demands. No hidden fees. Ease of use.\n",
            " - Very helpful and informative...super polite representatives..Class act in banking🤗\n",
            " - Super excited about about all this business banking has to offer.  Love the personal interaction when needed with a face and a profile behind the representative.  The opportunity to reward its employees...bonus.  Novo is fitting my companies needs.  Julie\n",
            " - Great alternative to a traditional bank. I opened my business checking account with Novo and I am super happy with the experience. It integrates with my ecommerce site and many more( like shopify, woocommerce, etc)  sites which a traditional bank doesnt.\n",
            " - Easy & User Friendly, Accurate & Efficient, Best for online banking with all the facilities same as physical bank\n",
            " - I have no problem with taking care of a problem app is cool with me\n",
            " - Great but not perfect! Zelle is really important and they don’t offer that.there is an invoicing system but it’s really basic. Needs a lot more functionality.  They should also let you confirm what is going to be written on your card before they send it to you.  They are good about getting back to you through app or email but would be great if they had a call center once in a while, but this is much better than any other options out there.\n",
            " - Novo sells you on the no fees to get you to sign up but once you're in, there's no easy way t reach out to costumer service. Also, through ACH transfers they charge your clients a fee. So technically you don't pay any fees but your clients do which makes it hard for clients to pay you because no one is willing to pay a $17 fee on top of the service provided to them. They also don't have Zelle yet. The concept of NOVO bank is great, virtual app and easy to use but they still have a lot of work to do in terms or costumer service, being able to actually speak to an agent and making it easier for clients to pay you without charging them absurd fees.\n",
            " - I could not ask for a better bank that is willing to work with you\n",
            " - Great so far especially the no hidden fee policy\n",
            " - You're terrible, because you are a bank -- however i appreciate the way you collect feedback, and it has been a good experience so far. It would be nice to be able to control permission over funding sources.\n",
            " - Novo has been great so far, well organized interface and workspace to manage various aspects of my business finances. I can see Novo being the idea bank for new business owners and entrepreneurs helping ease the load and save time as well as money.\n",
            " - I'm just starting with Novo, but I think our relationship will be long and profitable.  So far, everything has exceeded my expectations. I heartily recommend Novo.\n",
            " - I researched as many banking options for my startup business as possible.  I needed strong mobile support and debit/credit card access.  I started an application with another similar banking solution and they were not as responsive and easy to use as Novo.  I'd love it if Novo also had a high interest attached to their accounts, but at the end of the day, Novo provides everything a startup needs.\n",
            " - Novo takes complexity out of banking.It just work\n",
            " - Great full for quick helpful response. So helpful and understanding.\n",
            " - I switched from BlueVine to Novo hoping to access PPP funding. While the PPP came in via a third bank before I completed the process with Novo, Bank Novo had already won me over. They were communicative, personal and accessible. The communication makes it clear they want you as a customer and they are continually improving the tools.\n",
            " - No fees, they provide fast and easy support, and their integrations are a huge plus! Their user experience is phenomenal!\n",
            " - Overall great experience. Extremely easy to set up and very user friendly. Fantastic way to bank for my branding design agency!\n",
            " - seamless integration\n",
            " - I love how easy it was to open the account if you have all the proper paperwork on hand. I am very excited to get going on my online sales with novo and all it's integrations!!!\n",
            " - I love Novo. Opened my business account online without the bureaucracy of the old school banks and the process was seamless. The app looks clean and is very user friendly with no clutter of information. I’m very glad I chose Novo for my business banking.\n",
            " - Never used an online bank before.  These guys make it super easy!  Fees are amazing.  Service is stellar.  App gives me everything I need from a bank.Love my experience!  Highly recommend them.\n",
            " - Novo is great! I was looking for a free business banking solution that would allow me to pull CSV files and went with Novo instead of BlueVine because BlueVine sells your information (read the fine print). It's easy to use and definitely a modern banking solution. Thanks for all you do Novo!\n",
            " - Everything works as advertised. Only issue is certain integrations such as invoice ninja are non-existent for banking info, but for the most part, I am satisfied. UX is great.\n",
            " - The best banking family ever!!! They make you feel like your with family having a heart to heart with your favorite cousin!!?\n",
            " - Very helpful any questions that I have they always get back to me the same day. They are always respectful and go above and beyond to make sure they can help with any problems that arise I would definitely recommend them whether your business is small or large .\n",
            " - So far,a wonderful experience,  when I have questions,  someone answers my chat and explain the answer in a courteous, professional and caring manner.   Love the dashboard,  will start using the mobil check deposit weekly starting Monday and excited about using the other tools like invoicing.\n",
            " - Novo is a complete piece of kaka. It is not really an online bank, but moonlights as an online bank to gather information about people.They are not an American company. They say they are European, but I doubt that. Their banking platform is slow, their customer service requires a century of emails back and forth..All they care about is they got your personal and business info. The FBI should take a look.\n",
            " - Novo is great. Working to integrate features Azlo had, which is awesome. Customer service is amazing. There was a backlog on cards going for new customers due to the influx, but it did eventually arrive.On top of all they offer and working on offering, I hope to one day see the ability for cash deposits (GreenDot or Vanilla Express program). In the meantime, I'm utilizing another virtually featureless bank for cash deposits and moving funds from there to Novo.\n",
            " - So far, so good. I love the simplicity of the app.\n",
            " - applying for my account was smooth and easy. making deposits I received from my customers was painless. I enjoy that I can send invoices too. I already referred a friend and it was just as easy for her\n",
            " - Change is hard. I was recently forced to change business banks since Azlo is shutting down. I liked Azlo, I did not want to take the time to research a new bank. Since I was being forced to change, I wanted to go with a local bank, but after checking out a bunch they just can't compete with online banking for a small business. I read lots of positive and negative reviews for all the online small business banks and people either love or hate all of them. After one month, my experience with Novo has been nothing but positive. Of course there are some differences, but mostly stylistic. I have interacted with Novo support a number of times and each time they have been prompt and thorough.\n",
            " - I really been impressed. I have used them for a few weeks I used to have Azlo which I loved but they went out of business. Really the visibility on app and integration with other things like stripe and quickbooks make it amazing. Ooh and there are NO FEES!  What is not to like. I have already referred my brother and been very impressed.\n",
            " - Well designed app. Fantastic support. I feel confident they will be able to support my growing business.\n",
            " - At first I wasn't in too sure about an online bank however, they turned out to be a very reputable, honest, and reliable establishment. I highly recommend Bank Novo.\n",
            " - Quick response to any issues we have, solid interface, intuitive, and up with the times with what entrepreneurs want to see and need to run their business. Keep going Novo!\n",
            " - Works really well for my photography business. Was approved within a day or two of applying. The app is really well designed and has a lot of features. Received my debit card in about 2 weeks of applying. Would recommend!\n",
            " - So far, Novo has been very fast to respond to questions, and easy to work with. Not many banks can claim such a thing!\n",
            " - I am happy to bank with you but greatly inconvenienced by my inability to link my CashApp, Square, and PayPal to this bank. The issue with PayPal seems to be on their end, but it is just causing a lot of extra unneeded stress for me.\n",
            " - another loser bank. if you have time to waste.....\n",
            " - I received answers, help, and quick responses whenever I have asked questions. I appreciate a company/people that know there job and performs in a professionals manner. Thank you I have and will be referring Novo to my family, friends, and colleagues.\n",
            " - I received answers, help, and quick responses whenever I have asked questions. I appreciate a company/people that know there job and performs in a professionals manner. Thank you I have and will be referring Novo to my family, friends, and colleagues.\n",
            " - so far super cool on line experience without needing to go to the bank with Covid-19 and such it has been super clean and NOW in every respect. Just waiting to see if your bank has limits on amount of wire or the accumulated wire amounts in any given month before I make my first deposit.\n",
            " - Novo Bank is the best, I waited for their banking product and they did not disappoint, even more they can replace Azlo bank now that it closed.\n",
            " - Great bank- very responsive when I had an issue and followed up after.\n",
            " - I wasn't very happy Because the application would not accept my address seems pretty silly to me I've had the house for 20 years and I don't know why doesn't show up on UP on USPS  map other than the fact that there is no mail delivery in my town But a couple of your people have done very well by me  So I am happy thus far I guess we'll see I am  Always sceptical always pleasant you surprised when I actually end up liking who I'm working with who's taking care of me and especially in the banking business I am so sick of fees I went to an ATM I thought well I don't want to spend $5 not get enough money so all going to do 300 So my bank bank of the bank robbers Bank of the West charged me 18 dollars  If you can believe that For using a non bank of the West atm well then they list a whole bunch of purchases as ATM Last month the last month I'm going to be with bank of the West ever it's crazy they charged me over $100 In ATM fees last month So I'm done\n",
            " - Good fast support.  Transparency.  Does it's job.\n",
            " - Novo has been a great experience for my consultation business - allwos me to quickly connect my accounts and receive payments. Their new invoicing feature has been a game changer for me, especially since it's free.\n",
            " - I hate banks. Except this one. I consider all financial institutions to be a necessary evil. That being said, Novo has made business banking as pain- free as could possibly be expected. Very impressive customer service. Genuinely kind and helpful people that work there.\n",
            " - Novo has a slick interface, but really strange policies. Why put such a low ACH limit in place? Why automatically withdraw TransferWise funds for 3 business days?\n",
            " - Great bank! I recommend Novo to everyone! They have amazing features that fit my needs, and some I didn’t even know I needed for example “the reserve” where you can put money to the side for any category you would like! The layout of the app is great! Very easy to understand, I really enjoy logging in and seeing an inspirational quote every time.  Novo has amazing amazing customer service! They treated me with respect and I felt as though all my questions and needs were met.\n",
            " - Novo has been a blessing. Easy to open an online account without having to run the risk of exposure. Novo banking is painless and seamless.\n",
            " - I am a sole-proprietor small business owner,  and I needed a way to keep my business expenses and income separate from my personal ones.  After a Google search and some research,  I decided to give Novo a try.  Super glad I did! There is seamless integration with PayPal and stripe, and my business debit card arrived very quickly.\n",
            " - I was able to get my card activated and the representative was very courteous and showed  a willingness to help with my issue.  I love the features this bank offers  so much that I have recommended it my friends  with small businesses.\n",
            " - I greatly appreciate Novo bank and have never had major problems or issues. I have contacted support multiple times and have always received a timely response. The application process was simple and straight forward. Novo bank has been excellent for me and my banking needs and I highly recommend them.\n",
            " - I've been very happy with Bank Novo, I really like the ability to send checks back to people at the click of some buttons and not have to rely on having physical check in house anymore it's really nice. Their platform is very straight forward for a digital marketing agency or any type of online business. I plan on staying with them for a long time to come (: Worth trying out if you are just starting out and needing a quick easy modern solution.\n",
            " - Started freelancing a few months ago and needed a straightforward, simple account to handle client invoicing. Novo has been perfect for my needs - I love that it's intuitive, zero-fee, and offers a variety of helpful integrations should I need them. Highly recommended for people looking for an easy business checking option!\n",
            " - Good bank for my streaming! Lovely phone app as well.\n",
            " - Easiest business bank I’ve ever had. Simple but well thought out, love it.\n",
            " - My experience with Novo has been nothing but fantastic! I am a sole proprieter broadcaster on Twitch.TV and Novo has been an excellent and safe place to hold my business funds! I've had a couple experiences where I requested support and each time a Novo rep got back to me quick and made the situation better than I expected. Also the fact that there are no hidden fees is a BIG plus!\n",
            " - well, when it comes to Business Online banking, the question would be how reliable and trusting it would be. With Novo, i have experienced the best banking customer service as well as the simplest online system & Policies. opening a bank account during Covid with some banks, was almost close to impossible. however, Novo made it like a Peanut butter cream. easy, fast & efficient. No hidden fees, actually no fees at all. and you're not capped by any chance. really, THANK YOU NOVO. You made it simple!\n",
            " - Novo has been the perfect bank for me to start my business. It’s very straightforward and integrates well with tools I need such as stripe. Very happy with the new reserve feature as well. Novo listens to its customers and delivers\n",
            " - March 2021: I used to love Novo. It worked great for me until they broke Quickbooks integration to force you to connect from Novo to Quickbooks instead. At first they said they didn't know what was wrong and were working on it. When I asked for an update they reported this change was due to Novo security requirements and I'd have to connect from Novo to QB instead. I then asked why they didn't provide any notification of this change and they replied again that they didn't know what was wrong and their developers were working on. Clearly the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing - this is really bad for a financial institution. I bit the bullet and connected from my Novo account to my QB online. Unfortunately this is where things got bad. Rather than asking me which QB account I use for my bank acct they automatically created a new bank acct in QB and pushed every single transaction as new which has totally screwed up my books. I can't in good consciousness recommend them to anyone.Original Review:Novo is the perfect banking solution for my small business. I was able to open it online, it integrates with Stripe and Quickbooks, and I can do nearly everything I could do with a brick and mortar bank but without all the fees.\n",
            " - Novo makes having a business easy. I can easily track my transactions, create spreadsheets to monitor spending, and receive payments made directly to my account.\n",
            " - Novo was the first bank that I could find that honored my non-profit business.  I am grateful to be able to legitimize what I’m going to do in the military community.  I will recommend other non-profits in which I am involved to choose Novo.\n",
            " - Opening a business checking account has never been so easy. I had the documents they needed and it took me less than 10 minutes to enter my information unlike the other banks; I’ve had to go into the branch and it took a couple of hours. I had a question and NOVO customer service was really responsive!! I like their integrations for ACH and online wires. The best part is it’s free. Try to get that at your local branch.\n",
            " - My experience with Novo so far has been great I had nothing but great experience use ANOVA novo. To make it better in my opinion give customers check books.  I don’t really use checks often but I would just love to keep a book in my house just in case I need to send a check in a timely fashion\n",
            " - Novo is an excellent source for online digital banking. I love the simplicity of their platform. It is stable and intuitive.\n",
            " - Setting up my business account was really easy and my interactions with support staff members have been excellent. Novo also connects you to excellent discounts with service providers my company uses. I look forward to opening additional accounts with them.\n",
            " - Tyler, the cofounder, reached out to me to encourage me to apply for the second PPP loan. I did so using the online system provided by NOVO. The entire application process went pretty smoothly. Any bumps that popped up were immediately addressed.\n",
            " - Novo is very easy and intuitive to use for a founder of a startup or small business. The integrations and perks feature many commonly used startup platforms (Slack, Stripe, QB, Google Ads, etc) and the discounts provided are very helpful!\n",
            " - I have nothing but good experiences to report! Novo and its staff have treated me very well. Customer support is always quick to respond and able to help. No fees, no hassles, they get it. Very happy that I made the switch.\n",
            " - Novo is an online business banking account that I can control from anywhere. It has no fee's, no balance requirements, and it does exactly what I need it to do. I love Novo and I am happy and proud to be associated with them and their team.\n",
            " - Novo bank is reliable and make my task simple and easy to perform. I trust them totally.\n",
            " - Easy to set up and link to payment portals. Beats brick & mortar banks.\n",
            " - BankNovo has given me the alternative my company needed instead of using large commercial banking institutions. They are transparent with their fees (when/if they charge any at all) while most banks have a hidden fee schedule. The app is simple and easy to use. I have been banking with them for 2 years and love the direction they are progressing towards\n",
            " - I'm here for any improved digital platform experience for Buyers who are also Users.  Novo delivers and has been an amazing partner since starting my business during a pandemic-driven year.Signing up with Novo was easy and integration with my invoicing system was effortless. I'm very excited that Novo has implemented an invoicing process within their own platform because this means I can handle my business banking and simple invoicing in one system!\n",
            " - Overall very happy with Novo.  For an online Bsnk they are responsive and offer many benefits.  Like refunding atm withdraw fees.Would Be nice yeah you could transfer money out I’ll be a town like if you’re an independent contractor and want to pay yourself. We can transfer money in we should be able to transfer money out.  It’s a minor issue but would be nice\n",
            " - I transitioned to NOVO because of the fully featured virtual banking options and have been delighted at the clarity and communication they've provided since signing up. My prior business bank lost my business due to poor communication, customer service and fees. I've been highly satisfied with my transition to NOVO thus far and look forward to continuing to be well-cared for moving forward.\n",
            " - Flexibility, mobile, and no account minimums. Great and quick communication about all my questions and concerns.\n",
            " - I deeply enjoyed banking with Novo. Not only does it provide all the digital banking features I seek, but it's customer support and product team members are so helpful! I feel as if my needs are addressed and treated with respect! Will continue banking with Novo for years to come.\n",
            " - Novo bank has done a lot of things right and like all start-up companies, has and exciting journey ahead. We decided to use Novo mainly because of their integration with Venmo request for us to transfer payments for rental income. There were a couple occasions where I used their support to help answer an integration question and also to help my co-owner get signed up on the account. Both times they were quick to respond and friendly. If there was one comment I would make on improving the product/experience, it would be related to signing up a new user on the account. The process is a bit disparate and can be a tad confusing\n",
            " - Terrible cust service and understanding of banking needs of businesses.\n",
            " - I've been using Novo since launching my startup about a year ago, and my experiences have been exclusively positive. Know there are some mixed ones on here, but I got my card in a timely manner and the app has consistently worked as expected. I knew they were a startup from the beginning, which perhaps changed my expectations somewhat, but I continue to see the product improving rapidly -- something that doesn't happen at a big bank like Chase or Wells Fargo. I really love that it's built specifically for small business owners, and I really love the integrations with all the other tools I use to run my business. My sense is that the team has been taking some of these negative reviews as feedback, and have been continually making improvements. I look forward to remaining a customer/user for the long run.\n",
            " - The application process is absolutely asinine. I was denied three times (applied separately per their suggestion) for absolutely no reasons. When you ask to appeal the decision you are denied. When you ask for more information pertaining to your denial they will not share information - which I am confident is a violation of the FCRA. Glad I never got out the gate, customer service is abhorrent.\n",
            " - They denied me without providing a reason. I reached out for a reason and they refused to tell me. This is completely unprofessional. Stay away from them.\n",
            " - Terrible experience. Their on boarding process is maddening. I had to upload documents multiple times, gave them exactly what they were asking for, and still was denied.\n",
            " - They suck. Can’t communicate with anyone. Turn around time is days. Trust these reviews\n",
            " - Seriously, how can they call themselves a bank without even having an Android or web app?\n",
            "\n",
            "Cluster 1:\n",
            " - It was easy to set up, with no hassle like some other banks. Making name, EIN, and other changes later was easy as well and the support team was courteous and efficient. I highly recommend Novo online bank for your company banking.\n",
            " - Brilliant service. Easy to use. Has features that make it easy for me to transfer money and manage my taxes. Always innovating and reaching out to their clients. So much more proactive and less faceless than a traditional bank.\n",
            " - I have zero complaints about Novo. My favorite thing about them is probably their app. It’s so convenient, very straight forward and easy to use. I just love that I can login and send a payment, make a transfer, etc in seconds. I use the mobile deposit feature a lot and while there are a good amount of steps to complete, it is again very easy to use and convenient.\n",

            " - Love our bank. We are able to pay contractors simply, easily, and quickly. Easy to use system.\n",
            " - Novo is easy to use, trustworthy, and reliable. I only have minor complaints, like the way they show your payment history - I get confused about whether a payment is reflected in my total balance or not. I left them a note about this and hope they will adjust it soon. Other than that, I love Novo. It's super easy to make payments to outside contractors, to my personal account, etc. It's free to use, but you don't get interest on your account balance, so it's best for smaller companies where interest would be negligible.\n",
            " - Truly Free Business Checking. Novobank is easy to use and a great option if you need a simple business banking solution.\n",
            " - We chose Novo as our business bank account after our previous account shutting down. Novo has been an amazing experience for us. The platforms are easy to use, the features and benefits are great. We never had any issues with them and plan on using them for a long time.\n",

            " - Easy to use and great for my small business.\n",
            " - Novo Bank is easy to set up and easy to use. The interface is streamlined and quick to navigate. Only limitation I've found so far is that you can only transfer out up to $5000 at a time, which could be a problem if you have a large direct transfer payment you need to make.\n",
            " - Was able to open a business account during pandemic. App is very easy to use. It was pretty limited at first, but the multiple reserves is awesome. Highly recommend. Pay bill is lacking, not as advanced nor can you schedule payments to be sent out.\n",
            " - Super easy to navigate and we get a response for our inquieries very fast!\n",
            " - Easy to use. Clean and nice statements.  Wish my payouts could process quicker than 2 to 3 days.\n",

            " - Novo is amazing! Its super user friendly and easy to track everything. When I need to pay someone or send money they make it easy with one easy step. Other banks you cannot send money like this. Its my favorite feature. If you looking for the best digital bank, you will find it with NOVO.\n",

            " - Great business checking. Easy signup, no fees, fast ACH. I love it.\n",
            " - Novo is a great bank for sole proprietors.  They are very easy to work with.

Their website and their app are both easy to navigate.\n",

            " - Loving my business experience with Novo. Their app is easy to use and has all the features I need. The team is responsive to inquiries and requests for future features. Recommended!\n",
            " - I love novo, easy to set up online. I Didn’t feel like I was being over sold on anything. Got my MasterCard within a couple of weeks. I love how I can see all my info via the novo app. They also make it simple to connect your Stripe account if you use that. I recommend this to anyone with a small business.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cluster 2:\n",
            " - They don't charge any fees to keep an account. The new customer service phone number is somewhat helpful. At the end of the converation they always tell you to submit your query through the app so it is a little worthless to call them. They do respond quickly via the App. However, they used to reimburse unlimited ATM fees but as of January 2024 they will only reimburse two fees per month whcih is a downer.\n",
            " - I love the simple interface & the ability to put funds aside in reserve. The business features are fantastic, above and beyond what many banks offer. I took off one star because it's been a struggle to make this account interface with Paypal at all, even using a manual connection. I'd like to use this as my primary business bank account, but I have to maintain an account somewhere else in order to deposit Paypal funds. The support has not been at all helpful with this.\n",
            " - Novo allowed our account to be hacked!!! Do not use Novo. More than $8000 was stolen from our business account. We reported this to Novo and no one from the fraud department or anywhere else has contacted us back to resolve the issue nor have we been offered the protected amount of $250,000 that our money will be protected, was not protected at all, this bank is the worst. Novo’s agent is responsible for the hack. They allowed our business email address to be changed by a hacker and allowed our account to be broken into and no one is trying to fix it on Novo side.\n",
            " - I received a request to open a business account and I did, as a tax preparer, I thought it would be a good idea to use my novo business account, which I did. However, after a few days of the account being used fro business, they closed it. Worst company ever\n",
            " - Novo works well for me as a part time independent contractor. I was able to easily open a business account online. It charges no fees, and it integrates smoothly with Quicken. It provides useful additional functionality, particularly invoicing, which eliminates the need to create invoices manually.One weak point is customer service. It is only available in the mobile app, not on the web. And it's not real time: you leave a message and wait until they get back to you. I had a question about an international transaction via SWIFT, admittedly an uncommon situation, and the rep wasn't able to provide an explanation beyond sending me a dump of cryptic transaction details.\n",
            " - Once they made all of the upgrades, this was perfect for my small business. The big bank \"Chase\" hate them, wanted to charge me a ridiculous fee just to have an account because we were not moving large sums. Novo was a life saver.\n",
            " - Novo is pretty great for small businesses. From the sign on process to receiving a very cool looking debit card, I feel very set up for my business. The reasons for rating 4-stars is mainly for two things. I noticed being able to use Novo on my computer stopped working after a while, even after updating the app. This is unfortunate since I save receipts on my laptop and then upload the receipts when I have time. Now I can't do that. The other reason for the 4-stars is how long it takes to deposit a check. Currently it takes about a week for my checks to go through. This does slow down my process for taking care of bills and other things. Other than those two things, I'm a big fan of the \"reserves\" and how little fees Novo charges me. Highly recommend others to look into Novo if they need a business account.\n",
            " - Very simple concept,  no headache, the only thing missing is the login confirmation through email ( you must have US phone number )\n",
            " - Horrible. Issues with every check deposit. Never had ANY with Chase. Multiple checks rejected. One with no reason. One saying it looked altered. And they make you write \"at Novo\" on back which ruins trying to deposit at a legit, well functioning, professional bank like Chase. Trying Amex business checking now...\n",
            " - I recently encountered a troubling series of unauthorized withdrawals from my Novo Bank account, and the process of resolving these issues has left me thoroughly frustrated.Upon discovering the unauthorized transactions, I reached out to Novo Bank, only to be informed that they couldn't refund the money after 48 hours. They redirected me to contact PayPal, but after doing so, PayPal confirmed that there was no account associated with the withdrawals.Novo Bank allowed me to file disputes for three transactions within the last 60 days, resulting in a refund. However, I was unable to report older unauthorized PayPal transactions. Novo Bank also requested that I sign an \"ACH stop payment form,\" but the process became confusing when I found out I needed to sign four forms instead of one, despite receiving only one form link.In an attempt to safeguard my funds, I transferred the remaining balance out of Novo Bank, only to face yet another unauthorized PayPal withdrawal. Most disconcerting was Novo Bank's refusal or inability to investigate the source of these unauthorized withdrawals. Despite my request, they claimed they couldn't trace the culprit.Novo Bank's inadequate response to these security lapses is deeply disappointing and raises serious concerns for anyone seeking reliable financial security. Caution is advised for those considering Novo Bank as their banking partner.\n",
            " - Novo saves me time and money. No fees or charges and I have been with them for almost a year. I pay all my bills on line from my Novo checking account. Don't hesitate to open an account.\n",
            " - They canceled my account without any warning. Was expecting a big payment and Now boom account gone. Even those they send multiple emails a week they didn’t communicate anything to me. Now they want me to click and fill out links from outside their company which makes me think they’ve been hacked and/or comprised.\n",
            " - This is Harold Potter I never ask you to close my account with you\n",
            " - Very good bank. I save thousands of dollars paying my bills on time. Money comes into my account on time.\n",
            " - This company will close down your bank accounts for no reason randomly and steal whatever money you have.\n",
            " - I wish I would have read more about Novo before creating my first business account with them.  Customer service is nearly non-existent. There is no phone number,  only messaging which will send a generic response and close the ticket. Once the ticket is closed, you cannot respond. It takes over a week to see answers to simple questions.   Once the final credit shows in my account, i'm moving my money out...I've been waiting a month for it to be reconciled.    Zero trust in this company.\n",
            " - TeeeeTeee Replying To NovoWow !! Thats The Fastest Customer Service Has Ever Replied. Really Replied At All. Lol How Ironic. AnyWhom, No Need To Know My Information The Account Was Closed Out For Absolutely No Reason After Holding My Funds For Almost A Month. I Was Stuck With No Money & No Customer Communication At All. Im No Spiteful Troll Lying On This Company Only Sharing From Personal Experience.\n",
            " - Customer Service is challenging since it is all done through the app.Once my transferred funds were lost and did not deposit to my external account for over 7 days.  I had paid for the funds to be expedited to cover incoming bills, which I was charged for insufficient funds.  Novo did not reimburse the expedite charge nor the bank fees incurred.  I thought an online small business bank would give me ease with transactions.  It has been far from my experience.\n",
            " - An employee at Novo  stole money from my account. I had it frozen for fraud and she unfroze it  and transferred money to someone. Novo is refusing to refund my money. I have filed a Better Business Bureau complaint and a police report.Do not use this bank!UPDATE The thief changed my logins to the account so I can’t access any messages from the company. They refuse to contact me any other way. Maddening!!! There are no customer support lines to call\n",
            " - The bank is Horrible! They steal your money if you’re not paying attention. Your balance will go up & down and it doesn’t show on your statement. I put money in a reserve which is just a savings account, tried to transfer it to checking and it just disappeared! I called the bank serval times and it’s an 1 Indian man that answers the phone everyday. This bank is a scam! Don’t trust them with your money!\n",
            " - No response to tickets opened via web portal. General question. Links provided in previous tickets don't work. Rejects charges by major shipping companies that has gone through previously without any issue. Card gets shut off frequently because \"they don't trust\" it.\n",
            " - They are NOT A BANK. My experience with Novo has been more painful than going through hemorrhoid surgery without any pain medicine and then having to wear cactus underwear for three weeks as you heal. Our BUSINESS CARD, the one we use to take clients out, purchase travel expenses for guests, etc. is getting declined due to SUSPECTED FRAUD EVERY WEEK. I can order $3k worth of electronics from China and Novo doesn't bat an eye. I try to buy a $40 lunch for a client and the card gets frozen due to suspected fraud. I then have to go outside, call customer service, and deal with the person on the other end thats in a terrible mood and barely speaks English.Save yourself the problem and find a service that will work for you, and not make you look like a fool in front of your clients.\n",
            " - I am so disappointed that you guys would cash a check mailed to your bank after my account has been closed. Are your staffs stealing customers money? I got a check mailed to novo by Arlene Santor and it was after I learned that novo will shred checks mailed to them but after about a month the check was withdrawn from the customer account. This is shameful NOVO especially with the fact that you already closed the account.\n",
            " - 4 months of automated text after Novo allowed 10+ fraudulent charges to post on my business account. Nearly wiped out my funds. I don't know how I managed to keep my business afloat basically without funds for 4 months. I like the small business features but keep less than $100 in this account out of fear of this happening again. I have since opened an account with a brick-and-mortar institution that values security.\n",
            " - Great online account, no complaints!!\n",
            " - I lost trust in them after they asked me to send my identification via unsecured email and then held my businesses money because I would not do so. Ridiculous. To this day, I do not have access to my business account, even logging in with the original device where they can see the IP address, same login information, etc. At one time they were good. Along the way, I've seen similar stories from others online. They are not trustworthy any more and I will only bank with entities that have a brick and mortar location because of this.\n",
            " - My company, TravelVilage, used this account sparingly for my business. I had a transfer come in and a Novo employee gave some access to my account and wiped it out. I have been waiting a month and still no resolution. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH YOUR MONEY. I am filing a police report but don't have much hope. They give me the run around every day.\n",
            " - I love Novo's app. But I had a check where the persons signature touched the routing number on the bottom of the check, and Novo would not deposit the check. Their customer service person told me I needed to go back and get a new check... So I had to go open a local account anyway... and at my local credit union they deposited the check no problem. Novo is cool until you have an issue like this and they are un willing to help...  And there's no actual location to go speak with someone who might actually be reasonable.\n",
            " - If I can provide them with a negative number I would. This bank does not have customer support for the most crucial departments in regards to your account. My account has been in review for over 2 months and my funds frozen after requesting it be closed 2 weeks after the basically closed account and have had ZERO followup to my several emails and then the team lead Kevin basically told me not to reach out until they have an update 2 months is way too long and then when you call no indications of anything can be provided. Super unprofessional, no supervisors ever available. Completely a waste of time and DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL! BEWARE!\n",
            " - I think my favorite thing about this app (which is not an actual bank, so please understand that going in) is how I can allocate funds into reserves.Other than that, I’m overall just really disappointed.Since it’s not a bank, it doesn’t generate any interest. I could move my money to an actual bank and actually be making a little money by keeping it there.They brag about how awesome their app is, but you can’t even access your own routing number and account number. (Their FAQ says you can, but the directions are just not accurate.) What a massive oversight.The customer service is terrible. They don’t even have a phone number. It’s just chatting, and it takes them many hours to respond. Conversations that could have been a five minute phone call. I ask specific questions and tell them that I read the FAQ, and it as either incorrect or there wasn’t anything relevant to my question. And they always answer with a link to the FAQ. I cannot stress how infuriating it is when people do not bother to read what you write them. 0/10 for customer support.I will say that it’s rare to come across an issue with the app. It functions adequately, for the most part. But when it doesn’t, it’s a HUGE pain to solve the problem.As soon as I have the time, I will be researching alternatives and cancelling my account with Novo.\n",
            " - The average time to have a check of around 5K clear is 14 days. Getting in touch with anyone is next to impossible. No one answers at the phone number available. To get support, you need to raise tickets which often go unanswered for days. That is not a way to conduct business. Nothing is easy with this bank.\n",
            " - Can't access the mobile app because i don't have email on my phone to identify my device a security code should suffice, this is bloody ridiculous plus trying to get a response back from support is nuts.\n",
            " - Customer support is atrocious. When an issue involving loss of funds in my account from what seems to have been a backend bug with telechecks and reserves occurred, getting a hold of customer service took multiple days, including what seemed like tactics to outright avoid providing customer support  over the phone (I.e leave a voicemail and we’ll get back to you (3 days later), the line getting disconnected, putting me on hold for half an hour and then saying they’d need to reach back next week, no representatives available). The in app text support option is buggy (you can’t see what you type as you type it) and the responses I received through that method were slow and canned - essentially ignoring the information I’d provided. My loss of account funds issue has not made progress over two weeks and remains unresolved. If the customer service was half decent I’d give 4 stars but it’s been so bad that I’m looking to switch banks at this point.\n",
            " - Don't do it!!It's because of positive reviews on sites like this that I opened a Novo account. It's been mess than a month and today I learned my account is frozen with no explanation. I filled a complaint on the BBB and learn I was far from the only one with this issue. Look up Novo Platform inc on BBB.\n",
            " - All three times (over a period of 2 years since I stopped using it and came back again) I have tried to move money into this account/app to be able to use it there have been problems, but this time was the problem to top all problems. I'm not sure if it's a scam, or if this software is really just that problematic, but somehow a $3,350 mobile deposited check DISAPPEARED from any/all activity on my account. Since Novo's support team didn't respond quickly enough, I contacted my client directly to have them cancel the check. I met my client at the bank and watched the clerk cancel the check in front of us. Yet somehow, NOVO DEPOSITED THE CANCELED CHECK TO MY ACCOUNT?! If I hadn't known better, I might be spending money that wasn't mine to spend. If I had money moving in/out of this account any faster, then I might not have noticed either of these issues AT ALL. I have frozen my virtual card, physical card, and am slowly moving my funds over to a bank account where I can visit in-person when I have an issue.To top it all off - the support section of the mobile app hasn't been working for weeks. I can only access support tickets from a desktop browser. Plus, everytime I add a comment or reply back it sends me a notification as if someone from the Novo support team has actually responded to my issue. Last, but certainly not least, when someone DID respond to my VERY detailed messages they asked for more \"clarity\". It's exhausting to deal with this app and surprising that it's got so many partnerships and integrations given the experience I've had.\n",
            " - I set up an account for my business with Novo because they market that they are designed for small businesses and they are user-friendly. After having the account for over a year and completing several deposits and withdrawals, I received a larger check from a customer, which they would not let me remotely deposit because it was above my limit. It took me 5 days to finally get someone on the phone from customer support to see if they could adjust my account, and their advice was to go deposit it in one of my personal accounts (which I can't do because it is written to a business not me personally) and that they couldn't help me. I asked if that is what they advised all their customers that have larger sales transactions to do, and they explained no they just weren't willing to help me because I didn't meet their standards. Wow!\n",
            " - I don’t who would give this bank more than a 1 star review. The idea that this bank has is great but execution is not good. Long pending charges up to two weeks. Checks take 7-10 days to clear. They will tell you the check has cleared and it really hasn’t it will even show on your end this information. Which in return makes it impossible to track your money. Do not use this company.\n",
            " - Novo customer service is not available over the phone. They do not list a phone number on their card. Support is not available much of the time I want it. It’s the price of free\n",
            " - I've been banking with Novo for the last three years. When Novo works, it's great. But when you have any issues whatsoever, their support is absolutely awful and almost nonexistent.I've been needing to pay my tax bill to the IRS which was due today (December 18th). I reached out to Novo on November 28th so I can enroll in the EFTPS. The EFTPS requires your bank to confirm your identity through your EIN number and your bank has to notarize this form. I asked the IRS how long this process should take and they informed me that the bank should be able to have this done within a day's time. Great. Or so I thought.It is now December 19th and I am still unable to make my payment to the IRS because Novo's support system is awful. I scanned the form as a PDF by December 3rd per their request. They sent me the document to fill out through their system on December 6th. I immediately finished it. I did NOT hear anything from them so by December 12th, I follow up asking what is the issue? Jasmine who is my point of contact then tells me she is waiting for the form to be filled out on Novo's end. I am getting anxious now because the clock is ticking and it has taken now two weeks with NO solution.December 14th Jasmine informs me the EIN is incorrect. I see that there is a typo on my end (this is my fault and I take ownership of that) and resend the form immediately with the correct EIN number.She then informs me that same day that the EIN I sent is incorrect. Um, what? I tell her she must be mistaken and send her the document from the IRS that has my EIN information for my business. She responds to be on December 15th stating that Novo does not have that EIN number, and has a different number instead. I am thinking, maybe they used my social security? Nope. It's some random number I have never seen before. Well, unfortunately, they need to verify the current EIN number. How am I supposed to confirm this when I literally just told you I don't know what it is nor never seen the last four digits you sent me? She then tells me I should be able to see it on my account dashboard, I send her a screenshot asking where? And then she tells me \"I let our account team know that viewing the complete EIN is not straightforward.\" Okay? So?It is now December 17th and I follow up again because I hear no update and ask to expedite the process. I hear nothing. It is December 18th and I follow up again and call Novo. The phone agent tells me there is nothing we can do. I call the IRS asking for help on this and they informed me that it is incredibly odd that this is taking SO much time and that it should take a day, maybe a few days at max. It is now December 19th and I still have no resolution. At this point, I could have opened another business bank account with someone else and easily have had this done. I feel so stupid that I did not do this in the first place. I no longer will recommend Novo as a bank, and will be closing my account.It is a shame because the product is great when it works, but I cannot in good faith recommend this bank anymore. I have recommended this bank to many of my clients and audience and will no longer do so.\n",
            " - The application is okay it's not great it's okay it has no accessibility features whatsoever in the application I myself am disabled I have very limited vision and I can hardly use the app.The company has issues as well every time I try to log into the app they decide I have to go through some more hoops from their security portal and as a person with limited vision I can't get through those things I have great difficulty with this Plus we went to deposit a grant check from Walmart a few months ago the only actual deposit that's ever been made into that account and it took a week to clear it it was only $400 but it took an entire week by the time we got the money cleared the program that we needed the money for was over so by giving it two stars I think that's about as high as I could ever rate the app itself or the company in addition we asked a question and oh my God we're just about shut down and lockedout of our account . One other thing the company doesn't understand that our account is for a non-profit and I am just the treasurer of that non-profit Corporation I'm not the owner of it this isn't my money I'm playing with it's their money and they treat it as though I have control over that money and I'm the only one with control over that money and that's just not true I have a board of directors that I have to answer to and a CEO that expects to know what's going on in that account.I did not ask for a support ticket, I was just responding to your request to rate you on trustpilot  II wanted a support ticket I would have filed for a support ticket I was actually explaining a problem that you have with your app and it makes it unusable for me.\n",
            " - I can’t use my card on money apps and I no longer can transfer funds to other accounts. Not sure why I even keep this this account…\n",
            " - I do like Novo bank, and I would continue banking with them if their check processing was faster. That is the only downfall. I deposit checks regularly and they take 2-5 days to clear, which I just can't always wait that long. They have these nifty little buckets for separating my money so that I set things aside for taxes and other business expenses. I like that a lot.\n",
            " - Terrible app. Can’t access the app and can’t even view my account. Really just trying to close my account at this point\n",
            " - Easy to use and set up. I also love the way it separates profit, revenues, operating expenses taxes by percentages. No minimum deposits! You also receive a debit card and can transfer money to another account.  I think this is the best business banking that is so user friendly.  My only complaint is how long it takes a check to clear. I've only deposited one and it took 5 business days to clear.  ACH would be faster of course. But you do have a small portion of the deposit to use quickly.But other than that I love it. It was recommended to me by my son who uses it.\n",
            " - My business account/card was compromised while I was out of the state, on St. Thomas Virgin Island, on vacation. I have confirmed travel documentation and other evidence that shows and confirms I was out of the state. My vehicle was broken into back home where I reside, and I was notified while in STVI that my card was compromised. I affirmed the fraudulent charges, did my reporting as requested by NOVO and ultimately, they took several months to investigate which resulted in them closing the investigation NOT returning my funds, providing NO appeal process and NO way to communicate with them without further explanation. I will be switching to a new business banking in the New Year. The customer service is non-existent because you cannot reach anyone.\n",
            " - They never sent my debit card after requesting 3 different times. So I'm not able to use my account..\n",
            " - Nova is a nice idea, but simply isn't recommended to small businesses at this time. Because of the following reasons:1-The debit card has limited use since  many sites view Nova's Debit Card as a prepaid card and won't accept it, including major accounts with whom I have contracts. 2-No telephone access to a live customer service person for 48-72 hours after a problem or help is needed. I consider this totally unacceptable, their are to many banks still around with 24/7 phone access3-No ATM Network allowing free withdrawals, which wasn't an issue until recently, because initially Nova refunded all ATM fees, now only 2 a month. Basically our Company is subject to ATM fees because Nova is still a small fish on Training Wheels.4-No Zelle access on their accounts. Nova does offer a free transfer feature to and from connected account withouta fee. But this option will takes days to receive or to be received. Yes, they have a same day expedited option which \"Charges\" an additional fee. But when I used this option, the still posted the next after paying the fee. Since it takes 2/3 days to be contacted by customer service I had no support during this failed transaction.5-Nova doesn't offer 2 day advance posting for direct deposits, in fact their deposits posts slower than any bank I have used in the last 20 years, not good if you're a small business with cash flow challenges or a medium size businesses who wants timely access to it's liquid capital.6-No interest bearing savings account, which isn't competitive since there are plenty of other internet banks offering 4% or more on their savings accounts, Nova gets another poor mark on this point. They do offer sub accounts which would be very helpful and productive, but without interest the sub account feature benefits Nova much more than its business customers.In closing, Nova is a nice group of people, those that I have had the opportunity to engage with.But overall as a business person who has been on their platform for almost 3 years I give them a failing grade and wouldn't recommend them at this time. Based on what I have seen I believe they are 2/2.5 years away from offering \"Tier One Services and Financial Access\" until, RUN!\n",
            " - There were several transactions from my account to a business somewhere in Africa that were not authorized. I contacted customer service and they denied my dispute. I asked for proof of the purchases and NOVO sent \"they requested documents from the merchant who provided enough evidence that the dispute could not be processed.\" NOVO didn't show me the evidence when asked for it nor a receipt or anything else with my signature that validates the transactions. Then, they just started closing my tickets without any explanation. NOVO is the absolute worst banking institution.\n",
            " - No one has helped me get into my account that I have had for a couple of years. I have asked for help over the years and I was directed to do something that didn’t work so it’s just an account that has never been used with $50.00 sitting in it.\n",
            " - Gone are the ways of old school banking. I don’t know why more people don’t open their business accounts at Novo. The business account is free and they offer better services than most banks. The interface is easy to navigate and easy to link with square and any other bank account and they have partnerships with other companies that offer discounted prices. I have no complaints about Novo. The name is kinda weird but they offer everything most banks offer. Maybe the only thing they don’t offer is setting up Zelle with your business account which I think only chase and Bank of America offer. Other than that everything you need is at Novo.\n",
            " - Some funds were stolen from my account at the end of March 2023. What's worse, Novo was alerted about the suspicion of theft even before any transaction took place. Unfortunately, they did nothing to stop the theft! So many tickets opened about the issue and Novo made only a partial return of my funds after 5 months! They're not only a very unsecure bank, but also keep your money like crooks! I've moved all my funds to another institution because of this experience. Luckily, the theft was a small amount.\n",
            " - My review is based on one thing, customer service. You can assume I had no issues with anything else.  My issue with Custer service is there is no support…by no support I mean no support. About 1.5 years ago I no longer needed my business checking account. I still have it with a minimum balance because I can’t figure out how to close it. There’s no phone numbers and multiple emails asking for help have gone unanswered.  I spent hours trying to hunt down how to close my account and gave up. I did get communication from them asking for a review, so here we are. If you don’t ever need any support and you never close your account then Novo is probably a great fit.\n",
            " - This company has never let me down. My funds are available right away and I do not have any problems with access.\n",
            " - My bank wasn't listed to connect to this account, but they made it easy enough with check deposits.  Everything has been exactly as described.\n",
            " - Whenever I deposit the check, it takes several days that the money get available and that hearts my  business. I have account with different bank when I deposit check, it takes less than 24 hours the money is available in my account.\n",
            " - Avoid this place at all cost. There are better options. I had money stolen from. I went on and messaged and called them. It took a week for them to get back with me. Then they said it could take 120 days to investigate and they won't replace my money till the investigation is over. I'm still waiting too. If I could give no star's then I would. Quite literally the worst bank.\n",
            " - I like Novo overall my only request is that when there’s  something room or a maintenance situation with the website, pls let you people know with a special email I was like 2 or 3 days I don’t remember without access to my account and I was really worry. I put a random date bc I don’t remember when was it\n",
            " - I had $300 STOLEN out f my account and after 8 months, customer service is still defending the thief saying they reviewed the account and show a purchase which was NEVER purchased. Don’t go with Novo, go Bluevine. It’s much better.\n",
            " - I've been locked out of my account for so long that I don't even think of myself as banking with them anymore. I contacted them about this and they don't reply. However, they do keep sending me emails for various things, including rating them.\n",
            " - Novo is slow, and their customer service is poor. After having fraudulent activity on my account, their team literally gave me the run-around. It's clear they had prepared statements, and the people answering the phone are really capable of providing you with answers or solutions. Just go to an established brick-and-mortar bank. Novo is NOT a reliable or efficient option. Closing my account this week.\n",
            " - Don't put your money in this bank if you need to withdraw it. Sometimes takes days to withdraw large amounts. Not sure why I'm restricted on how much of my money I can withdraw. I don't recommend this bank.\n",
            " - I love SO many things about this company—the ability to create cash “envelopes”, the user-friendly experience on the app and on the website. BUT, the process of getting a check cleared is so SLOOOOOW, it’s causing me to rethink the account. Often, if I deposit a mobile check, it takes an entire week to clear, no matter what the amount. Compared my previous Chase account, which often gave me immediate access to funds, it’s hard to justify the slow speed when I need to move my money quickly.Likewise, when I transfer cash out of the account to my personal account, it often takes up to five days. It’s nice that the account doesn’t charge a fee, but I’m starting to think that a monthly checking account fee would be worth it for more expedient access to my money.\n",
            " - Very disappointed in Novo’s customer service. I’ve received the same message from them for 3 days, Please know that your concern is still being reviewed by our team. I'll notify you once I heard back from them. This is unacceptable. They’ve made a $600.00 error, and I need my funds.\n",
            " - Really bad customer service, will deny charges you make on your card 8 times out of 10.  Doesn't have the features you'd expect from a bank.\n",
            " - I’ve have Novo for over a year, after Brex dropped us small businesses. I loved Brex because of the credit reporting and the points and I went looking for a comparable company and found Novo. They don’t have the points and credit reporting but so far it’s been a great bank. I had a couple of large deposits and didn’t have any issues other than someone tried to access my account but wasn’t able to. I did cheat on Novo and went back to Chase but when business slowed down I started getting hit with the monthly fees and decided to close that account and make Novo my main bank from now on and will send money to other banks for interest from there.\n",
            " - Great way to bank for my business.  It's easy to use, I can deposit checks and get confirmation of posting rapidly.  I don't like the delay in seeing the amount appear in my account. It takes up to four days.  I would think a check would clear sooner.\n",
            " - Novo Bank helped me get my new business up and going with just a few clicks. They even offered to give me a line of credit based on my deposits. They said I could use for purchasing equipment, paying bills or even just to have the spending money that day to day businesses often need.\n",
            " - I recently had the pleasure of opening a business account with Novo Bank and have been thoroughly impressed with my experience thus far. From the ease of account opening to the fantastic features and customer support in addition to free of monthly service, that other banks have.\n",
            " - I'm likely going to change banks soon. I haven't been happy with Novo. Twice, they changed my card numbers in a year for no reason. This meant the annoyance of going through every vendor/bill and updating payment details. A lot of time. Also, if you want to access customer service, they require you to download their app. No phone number exists. That's insane.\n",
            " - App is great just needs a little tweaking. I deposited a check and thought they would call to verify. Instead I received a return check fee. Too still deposit the same check in the account just a different day. They do respond too you as well. That's a great thing\n",
            " - Great service from the company.  I've had an account with them for a couple years, good integrations to other tools and the virtual debit card has been invaluable.\n",
            " - Super easy to open the business account. Five minutes versus 3 days in a local bank that required many more documents to say “no” but feel free to open a personal account and in six months send another request. Put this in the perspective that I was ready to issue my first invoice and needed a business bank account\n",
            " - I enjoy all the features of a business account and the apps that you can connect to the Novo account to manage business finances.\n",
            " - I'm moving to another small business bank. A support ticket I created for a big issue went completely unanswered. The functionality of bill payment is ridculously limited - in order to pay my business credit card, they have to print and send out a physical check which takes about 10 days to get to its destination.\n",
            " - Convenient and perfect for my business account.\n",
            " - The experience included my card getting declined only to find out that it was a system error on your side.  The issue is that you have the technology to inform all of your customers when you have a service to sell, but couldn't have given us a heads up that there might be an issue for a time?\n",
            " - So far I have been enjoying using Novo as my primary business account. The app user interface is excellent as well. I deposit my Square payments directly into my account seamlessly. The only complaints I have are the slow mobile check processing and the slow updating of my current balance in the app. It’s taken 5 days for checks to clear when I’ve experienced same day or next day availability of funds with other banks. Otherwise, so far so good!\n",
            " - We have been using Novo for our business banking since the company that we previously used closed.  We have been everything that we needed to including sending wire transfers, online payments, debit card withdrawals. I was worried about having an online only bank account, but it has been great.\n",
            " - I enjoy Novo's app. The tools I need to run my business and move money are easy to use and laid out in a way I can understand quickly. I particularly like their buckets feature where I can set money aside for purchases or taxes without locking that money into a Savings account.\n",
            " - One of the better business accounts I have ever had. No extra paperwork no credit checks to open an account. Just great service\n",
            " - I decided to give this company a try. Used it for a book payment that was conducive to running my business. Right before President's day a deposit was made. It took a full week for the deposit to show up when I paid for instant transfer. The funds were posted on their platform but the balance didn't reflect the funds.  Needless to say I got the run around from \"customer service\" with no real human answer just scripted answers from humans. I've decided not to use this service any longer. It caused a huge medd and there was no real explanation or resolution . I will no longer use this service.   I wouldn't let a customer have this type of experience  in my business  and didn't appreciate the way things were handled on Novo's end.\n",
            " - Novo support is bad, when you need support from a banking partner, there should be more than a basic email ticketing system.When my debit card was lost in the mail, Novo did nothing to help remedy the situation and I was left in a lurch without access to my banking funds. I’ve moved to Relay and am much happier.\n",
            " - Easy and reliable. I have no complaints. Depositing checks can take a while for available funds to reach your account. However, it's worked out for me when I plan ahead.\n",
            " - I like this card for my business. So far no issues and you should try it!!\n",
            " - I have been with this bank over 2 yrs. I had a few issues not the banks fault but lost of debit card and someone charged card. Bank was very responsive and helpful to get things corrected.\n",
            " - Just received this request for a review (surprisingly) if I could give a 0 I would!! This fintec is not and was not a good business banking choice for me at all!! Unable to speak with anyone when things go left also deposits made to account from consumers take forever to post!! Would not refer my worst enemy!!! Idk they emailed me for a review… so there ya have it!!\n",
            " - I would definitely NOT recommend Novo Small Business to anyone. My nonprofit was recently blessed with a 400 dollar grant from a well known company in the United States. I did a mobile check deposit within 3 minutes Novo sent me an email  telling me this check was believed to be fraudulent . The check could be easily verified. I would have even understood a 7-10 day check hold.  Please don’t any small business use Novo. Run 🏃‍♀️\n",
            " - Horrible customer service; third-party overseas and no one that actually speaks English. This is a Tech company and not even a real bank. Don't count on ANY support, for them to follow the law, or use Mastercard's zero liability policy if someone commits fraud and takes money from your account. They will NOT return the stolen money under any circumstances. Don't use this fake bank!\n",
            " - My account was hacked and most of the money was drained via large POS transactions over a few days.  It was impossible to reach anyone to speak to at NOVO and received no applicable response via message other than canned replies.  Yes, this was finally settled in my favor but after weeks of stress.  This is what you get with an online bank.\n",
            " - I’ve been using Novo for my banking for a couple of years now and they have been great. A couple of weeks ago I broke debit card and they had a new one in my hands in 4 days which included a weekend.\n",
            " - I like that Novo does not charge a fee for an account.\n",
            " - Having a digital bank account with the power to send invoices is really awesome. I haven't had any issues with my account over the past year and I'm very happy with the service.\n",
            " - Great for keeping my business transactions separate from personal bank account\n",
            " - No contact phone numbersNo check optionsJust a rebranded product from a small bank.Will be switching to a legitimate business bank soonUpdate for 2/5/24Was needing a credit letter from a vendor to lease a forklift. I’ve already started using 5/3 for my new customers, but I needed historical information. And this was urgent. It took 3 DAYS FOR THEM TO TELL ME TO SEND THEM THE FILE IN PANDADOC FORMAT! Go to your local bank and open a business account. This ain’t one.\n",
            " - I am in the process of leaving NOVO. I am tired of having the \"fraud ninja\" freeze my card every time I attempt to visit more than 1 store. I understand that fraud is rampant right now, however when I am trying to pay with a mile long line behind me and my debit card gets flagged, it is really upsetting. Also there hold times for check deposits is unreasonable. I have been depositing a check every month, same amount, for the last year from a client and every time the hold is 5 days.\n",

            " - I have had Novo online business banking for 1 year no problem. Then on November 13th 2023 around 2pm someone called me from a Novo phone number. They called me about fraud on my account. When I checked my account it was compromised and three charges were on my account I never made. He said did I make these transaction at these 3 different restaurants? I said no, and he said Novo will return the funds. He said Novo would send out a new debit card  and cancel the old one. Then he said he will update the security on my account, and had sent me a code to confirm. Once I gave him the code he hung up. I was then locked out of my account. I have tried to contact customer support by phone and email. \"No answer or response to over 10 emails. I am convinced that this was an inside job and Novo is a Fraud and a Big Scam... Novo is not a Bank they are a Scam company... They will rob your business and you can't do anything about it but take an \"L\"!!!\n",
            " - I never had any problem with novo....until now.In the last two weeks, I attempted to deposit $10,000 into my Novo bank account from my Shopify balance. Unfortunately, the funds did not reflect in my account, showing as imported and then immediately withdrawn or rejected on the app. Despite the 'Money In' and 'Money Out' sections indicating over $30,000 in transactions, this amount never appeared in my balance. After reaching out to Shopify, it became evident that the issue lies with Novo's banking system.This situation is disconcerting as a substantial sum of my money seems to be missing. These funds are vital for meeting essential financial obligations, including employee salaries, supplier payments, and inventory expenses. Whether it's a mistake on my end or a system error, the urgency of resolving this matter is crucial. I look forward to a prompt resolution and appreciate your attention to this issue.\n",
            " - Very disappointed that you give the callers such a hard time that if they don’t have the loan account number (WHICH IS VERY HARD TO FIDE) you refuse to provide phone services, though you explicitly asked me to call you by limiting my access to the line of credit, but then refuse to help! Are you serous!!!\n",
            " - I have attempted to get in touch with support from a foreign country (where my business functions) for 6 weeks and I’ve not received a single response. Even when I’ve tried to call, I exhausted nearly all my data allocation and after sitting on hold for 20 minutes was told there was no one to answer the call. This happened multiple times. I’ve attempted to get in touch on the app and by email and nothing.\n",
            " - Novo has some appealing features for a new small business owner, but their anti-fraud rules are simply too rigid to ensure a reasonable customer experience. Every month I have to request a new temporary expansion of my deposit limit with no apparent way to earn a permanently higher limit. I feel like every transaction on my account with Novo has some sort of issue or hassle. Most recently, a check I deposited several weeks ago (from a client whose checks have cleared repeatedly in the past) has been rejected twice for being a \"starter\" check, which it clearly is not. After reaching out to support the first time and waiting several days for a response, they said \"Upon a second review, our Team was able to accept the check and deposit it into your account.\" I just received a new deposit failure notification with the same explanation. Now I'm re-entering the process of waiting days for customer service to respond. It will ultimately be a month before I have access to these funds. As a bank branding themselves as perfect for small businesses, perhaps they should do more to understand the experiences of small businesses and particularly their cash flow needs. This kind of issue can ruin a company, cause them to have to take out debt, be late on their bill payments, and a hundred other consequences. Just terrible.\n",
            " - I had no issue when I need to transfer money into my account\n",
            " - My experience with Novo has been nothing shirt of AWESOMENESS! Iam so very pleased with the personalization being a business account owner,  and being able to access professional customer service reps to help make my experience a great experience. I know this seems too good to be true. YOU need to see for yourself. I have an individual assigned to my account, and he is spot on. I'm not used to someone contacting me directly for all of my needs. I'm so very pleased.  I feel like part of the family, not just another account number. Novo is a keeper!\n",
            " - Novo, put a freeze on my account due to it being under investigation. The account has been used a dozen of times if that. The account doesn't even have any money coming into it yet. I am working on opening a small business and I went to make a purchase, the purchase was declined and this is how I found out. Novo, does not give any indication that the account is having issues of any sort, whether they believe it to be suspicious or fraud. They actually give no information at all. And I mean AT ALL.  They repeatedly say over and over   \"Your account is currently frozen\" and \"In review by our Accounts Team, we are unable to speak to the specifics of this decision\" as well as \"We cannot provide an estimated time of resolution at this time.\" If you are here reviewing and weighing options of opening a Novo account, please think twice and do not do it. They are shady and highly unprofessional no matter how hard they try to act like they are. Putting this institution in charge of your money is the worst possible thing you can do. It is the worst possible thing I could have done and I wish I had someone to tell me so before making a mistake of joining Novo.\n",
            " - My funds were taken from my account the moment I realized this issue I informed novo. 2 days after the funds were taken I received an email to verify my identity.  I have been working for over 2 months to get my funds back. I do not get any updates on my case and the last message back was Nov 2nd, with the account team is working on it.So, now I get a message from novo saying that they're team replied to me. Yes they did replied that there is nothing they can do to get my money back since, the account my money went to has insufficient funds. And then when calling them I was told that they will message the dispute team and when I asked to speak to a supervisor I was told I can not talk to a supervisor and that he could only message them. And then I said I need to talk to some one else I was just hung up on. This is the absolute worst bank to deal with. Your funds are not safe and if you do have a problem they will do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for you.\n",

            " - In full fairness, originally I didn't rank Novo very high due to several issues and matters. Now my view on Novo has totally done a 180! After writing in, they actually listen and implemented many of the requested changes and fast! My 2 star rating is now a 4 star rating. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 yet, is because they have yet to include Zelle to their platform. They have said it's on their roadmap, but when you do your online research, it's been on their roadmap for years and years and years! That is a bit misleading, as other major banking platforms all offer that. I honestly don't think they will ever offer that, because Novo would loose money. If you want to transfer money the same day, currently you pay an extra rush fee... but the fee is excessive and the payment may not arrive in the other account until late into the evening, unlike Zelle which is free and instant. The other area Novo needs to GREATLY improve is their invoice system. Currently, if you invoice a client for the exact same amount and only 1 payment out of the 2 arrived, you have no idea what invoice they were paying. There is no reason for this in 2023 with the current technology. So that has been a bit of a problem when trying to use their platform as a company when it comes to invoicing. I've called in about this issue and the lady didn't didn't listen very well. After waiting days, I got an answer that didn't address the matter that I was calling in about. This is still unresolved as of 11/19/2023. Other than that, I would like to complement the team at Novo who answers the phones. They have been friendly and mostly helpful. I'm really hoping to see these other improvements very soon and currently would recommend, and have, to other new business owners to consider Novo over other branches like Wells Fargo, Bank of America and others major banks.  PS: They did offer a line of credit for my business. It was to be paid back in only 6 months, so that is the only downside. They currently don't offer 12-48 month plans. Bottom line, I think Novo is heading in the right direction and am excited for what's to come. That's my 2 cents of my honest and fair review.\n",
            " - I have been with Novo 2.5 years, and it has been a love/hate relationship. When things go right they have good system but when you have a problem that at a noral bank that would take 10 minutes to fix, at Novo if you get luckey figure 2 days just to get support then they are untrained and will give you canned answer that makes no sense as to your issue. This is why they have the 1 stars on here, when us small business have a thousand or more refund that you need from a purchase that the company never got the money PENDING for a week and you need that money to operate your business, the damage that can happen can be devastating, I have been waiting for 2 years for Novo to get real customer service and i am not sure if i can wait now.\n",
            " - Fraud, Fraud, Fraud  is all i can say. They responded and Lied in the trustpilot app stating they responded to me and never actually did. The last representative used the N word to me and thought i did not hear it.I will be suing them for everything they Have.These people have access to my funds and will not give them back to me. I will not stop untili bring this entire fraudulent company to the worlds eyes and every last penny they owe me.Again stay away from this bank if you have a small business,they have committed fraud against my acct multiple times and will not give me back my $$.\n",
            " - If I could give zero stars I would!  I have two businesses with Novo and ever since my second business was set up, Novo somehow got the two accounts linked. Whenever I create a support ticket using the new account it creates it under the older account and they refuse to help me because they accuse me of being logged into the other account. I have tried several times to get this issue resolved but they don't understand the problem. They refuse to escalate it to an IT department with someone that knows what they are doing.  They just tell me that in order to fix it I have to close my account and create a new one.  Not only that but I am unable to get anyone on the phone to help. All of their support is online via email and via their support section inside the portal.  A local bank would have had this resolved in 10 minutes with a phone call.  Certainly not sold on online only banks.Response to Reply:  I am not going to confirm my business name on a public forum.   There is an existing case underway for another issue that I can't get solved because of this. I have attached a photo of my login screen showing my login.\n",

            " - The experience thus far has been awesome. As a small business owner, it was difficult to find a bank that would allow me to open an account (especially without coming in-person). NOVO’s application and service is A1 and seamless. The response time is impeccable as well whenever I have a question/concern. The only reason I took off 1 star is because Zelle is not connected and money transfers take a little bit longer than I personally would like sometimes. However, those issues are not big enough to make me leave NOVO. I’ve been with Novo at least a year as of today (Nov 8 2023)\n",
            " - There is absolutely zero customer support. They only have chat, no phone customer service. I have been setting up an offshoot of one of my businesses for about 6 months now. I of course set up a separate bank account and credit card processing. I decided to wait until the first of the year. For no given reason they shut my account down. Not only that but they kept my money, granted it was less than $100\n",
            " - Novo was ok til they started blocking payments from my website company. It was on monthly autopay. Yet, every month they blocked the payment and froze my card. Security is great but when it’s overdone it’s a hassle.Getting the account unfrozen and the bill paid is a complicated time consuming process. And customer service was no help. I emailed and just kept getting messages back to check the app, which wasn’t working for me. It’s ridiculous the level of time and attention involved to get a monthly  bill paid. If you are looking for simplicity and a bank that helps keep your business running smoothly, look for a different bank. That is what I am doing!Update: See their response below! This is the reply I kept getting over email as well, even though I told them the app wasn’t working for me. This demonstrates a company that doesn’t have the flexibility to really listen to and help with clients’ requests.\n",

            " - Terrible experience I bought an item which was immediately refunded to me on behalf of the seller. However the money did not appear in my account yet. After speaking to novo i was told the charges will take 2 weeks to stop pending and the money will be deposited into my account. A month and some change later and I still don’t have the money. The chargers are still pending and i’m getting the same default response from novo. Run and do not trust this company with your money. If anyone can help me get the pending charges dropped, i’d appreciate it. I run a small business and $2,000 is a lot of money. I’m afraid this situation will cause my business to fail. Please run away from this bank.\n",
            " - Update: I was contacted by the accounting team and was told that my linked account was deleted and they do not know how. As far as I know as a customer, the only way to delete a linked account is to call in and request for it to be removed. I never authorized this. Now the only way to pay them and ensure I don't go into default is to manually send an ach each month. After disputing this by asking is there another way to set up payment so I can not be inconvenienced further, I was told no, this is the only way. I then asked for the ach instructions to be emailed to me. 4 days later with no email or instructions. The inconvenience with NOVO is beyond belief !The customer service is horrible !! I was offered a line from them over a year ago, just started utilizing it for my business's growth and it has been nothing but problems. Please be aware, do not take 2 or more draws at once and try to pay off the 1st one early; they will close your account for asking too many questions.Very long story short, I only accessed 10% of an $18,000 \"MCA\". After asking for clarity on how to pay off installment 1 in full, without paying an early monthly payment on installment 2; My access to the available funds were frozen. I asked multiple times what happened and waited for a response and received no viable answers. The following week the checking account was closed by Novo without warning. When I asked how they came to this seeing how I never missed a payment, nor 1 negative day in 4 years, Novo somehow came to the conclusion that I loan money directly (with no evidence or trace of this happening as lending has never happened). I offered to dispell this with any documentation they needed and it was declined. This ultimately led to their decision. I have over 5 checking accounts and this is the only bank to put me through this. After fighting to get the decision reversed, I just decided it is not worth the battle and just gave up. I was told by Ray & Thomas @ Novo's funding dept. that any monthly payments due would be taken from the external account that was linked to the advance due to the novo checking account being closed. I gave the okay for this and let it be. 2 weeks later I am now getting these messages saying they cannot take the payment from the \"closed\" novo account and to fund the account to avoid collections. The Wells Fargo account that is linked has been open longer than my novo account (same business) and also has never had a negative day, with over $5,000 average daily balance. I have sent money to the closed account which is then returned back due to the account not being found. I have called in regarding this and everyone says the same thing, \"hmm that's odd it should be coming out of the wellfargo account.\" After multiple automated messages asking for payment, I replied back at least 4 times to support@novo & accountservicing@novo and it has been 2 weeks with no response.Today, I now have another email stating the payment failed from the closed account (obviously) and that it will be sent to collections. Novo is purposely not taking the agreed payment in the form in which they agreed to and is now putting me in a potential default status!! I am doing everything I can to pay and they will not take a payment. I am pretty sure this is illegal under some collections act. Please take caution! I don't know what I am going to do about this.\n",
            " - My business partner and I have had an account with this bank for two years now, and we will be leaving for another bank as soon as possible. Last month, their site suddenly stopped uploading data to Quickbooks. We received no communication about it. It took almost two weeks to get resolved. I called NOVO and they confirmed the issue was on their end. Then last week, we transferred over $3K in payments that were supposed to show up in our personal accounts by Friday. They have been deducted from our NOVO account, but the $ transfers have not been received in either of our personal checking accounts. I have been trying to call the bank all day and no one is answering the phone or responding to my emails. This is completely unacceptable for a bank that promotes itself as made for small businesses.\n",
            " - I really wanted Novo to work. They have some great features and when it works, it’s great. BUT-  if anything goes wrong or you need any assistance— you’re basically screwed. The customer service aspect of this bank just doesn’t cut it. For a company with slick advertising about ease-of-use and making business checking easier, it’s clear that the time and attention has been placed solely on marketing and customers are just left to their own. -long wait times to get anyone on the phone. I’ve waited 30 minutes and no one answered. Left a message. No reply. -generic answers in the app and via a ticket system that didn’t solve the problem. They mentioned submitting a ticket and no follow up was received. - sent message via Twitter. Received canned response to DM a message for help. Nothing. I think the most frustrating part of working with this bank is really wanting them to be better but seeing clearly that they have made a business decision — even if X% of their customers leave because of poor customer service, they will have still maximized profit because they have “saved” money by not building any customer service into their business model. I cannot see any other way it could be this bad— except by design. It’s sad to see. I’d avoid if I had to do it all over again.\n",
            " - Simply closed the account with no reasoning. Very rude.\n",
            " - I love how easy was to open a business account and how wonderful it is to manage my business. Is like a bank for entrepreneurs. Also, I saved a lot of money just by opening an account with other tools that they have agreements.\n",
            " - I had a canceled and refunded transaction on my account. This bank placed a hold on my funds saying the hold would fall off in 14 calendar days. However, after 17 calendar days, they are still holding my money which I do not have access to. The worst part is that no one can give me an explanation of why my funds are being held for a transaction that was refunded over 2 weeks ago. They won't even tell me when I will be able to have access to my money. Customer Service is a joke. Do Not put your money in this bank!\n",
            " - UPDATE3: Novo has in fact reached out and reset things so I can use my account. No explanation why they disappeared for 3 days. No explanation why this issue keeps occurring. Just tell us to unlock the card and we'll do it. This is not the support level I read about when I first signed up and the primary reason I went with NOVO. I do not know what has changed in the last couple of months.UPDATE2: Another 24hrs and no response. Submitted a Please respond support ticket. With no other way to contact them and complete silence. This is very worrisome. UPDATE1: 24hrs and still no response from support. Submitted another support request.I had really enjoyed my banking experience with Novo until the last month or so. For the last two months they have started randomly denying my recurring subscription charges which they had been honoring for the previous 4 months without issue. The first month I let it slide even though their mechanism for authorizing the transaction wasn't working. I paid the subscription manually. Last month the same thing happened with the same subscription. Paid it manually. I submitted a help ticket and after 2 days of back and forth the help desk person told me they had no control over the software's approval or disapproval of my recurring subscriptions. This morning I received a notification from NOVO that they had denied another recurring subscription and the automation to allow authorization still isn't working. AND now they froze my debit card! The app is stuck in an endless loop that will not allow me to do anything and there is no way operate my business. I submitted a trouble ticket at 7am this morning. As of 4:30Eastern I haven't even received acknowledgement they have even looked at the ticket. I've checked my SUPPORT tab from my laptop and I see both the original trouble ticket & a follow on support email I sent in my submitted support stuff, but nothing from NOVO. Unless something happens to change this situation pretty quickly I am going to have to move on. This is so unprofessional and small businesses cannot operate like this.\n",
            " - I have nothing but good things to say about Novo customer support.  They have been there to answer all my questions and help me in my time of need.   Their fraud protection is a little too protective which is a good thing sometimes but when they keep me from using my own card they go a little too far.  They could use a quicker way like Zelle to transfer money in and out of account.\n",
            " - The bank is trash I hate I have to give it a 1 when I trans funds that’s supposed to be instant it don’t go into the next 24 hrs god forbid I’m in an emergency situation they always decline the card for fraud when there is no fraud im done I’m good off them worst business bank account ever I’m canceling at 9 in the morning this ridiculous & than you pay for instant but don’t get instant fraud asf\n",
            " - Overall, I enjoy using Novo for business checking. It’s a solid platform and very forward thinking. If you use Stripe, getting payouts a little early is a nice plus.The mobile app is slow to load - of all my banking or CC Apps, the spinning Novo Logo can take up to 20 seconds before you see your account balance.If you want to add your bookkeeper to l access your account, you have to actually add them as a member to the account - no online only/user ID only option. Slightly annoying.No TRUE MFA via Authenticator App, only SMS. For a bank so tech heavy, this is frustrating.There’s a bug with the ticketing module in mobile. ALL my tickets over the last 3 years show unread, even after I’ve read them. I’ve brought this up to support, but no rush to fix it. It’s been maybe a year since I opened a ticket about that.Sometimes I have to alternate between “move money” and dashboard to see my accurate account balance - it doesn’t properly update automatically.Also, on the main Dashboard of Recent activity, it’ll show recent transactions, but if you click on it for more details - the full transactions page is ALWAYS missing details of the first two or three most recent transactions. The App or PDF statements don’t show a running account balance. From a proper accounting standpoint, this is quite irritating.I know I just listed a slew of minor complaints, but would I choose a different business bank? Maybe. I keep hoping all these little bugs will be fixed in time. When I call for phone support, I usually get somebody in about 2 minutes which is a nice plus. Do I rave about Novo to my colleagues? No.\n",
            " - It's a good bank for small businesses. My company has used Novo for about two years now. What I like: -Easy set up. -No fees to maintain the account. -I can tell they are trying to improve overall. -They gave us a line of credit (probably the main reason we stay).-App integration - when a transaction is processed on Novo, it instantly gets posted to our Slack channel. Very helpful!Issues: -I had difficulty getting a replacement debit card. I gave up after trying and just used the online debit card for a while. -I found out I could not access all information on my online debit card on the web app. I could see more information on the mobile vs the web app which I found odd and confusing. -I did not like the phone experience of dealing with someone who seemed to know very little about Novo and seemed to be a contracted third party. This is a big reason we opened a second bank account somewhere else. Imagine if tens of thousands of dollars were tied up and your only help was being directed to an online support ticket system. I imagine they may have improved upon or are in the process of improving upon the above-mentioned issues.\n",
            " - Wonderful bank to deal with. Totally straight forward and helpful. I’m about to open another business account.\n",
            " - Great quality! I have not had many hiccups or issues with them. The one issue that I did have was when fraud was detected on my debit card -- it took over a month before I was able to receive a new card, which can be a bit of an inconvenience if you use the card often.\n",
            " - The account setup was super fast. Everything is intuitive so you don't need much help. It's nice to see Stripe payments show up much faster in the account. Novo is an easy choice.\n",
            " - Worst bank for a small business or start up business. It's impossibly hard to wire internationally. If you can't wire (I couldn't) you have a $5,000 daily transaction limit which means you're now asking your supplier to break up invoices in chunks so you can pay it. You can't deposit money, you need to get a money order and WHEN YOU DO they put a hold on the funds for five days. Same with checks. All of these things have caused such a headache for my growing company I would never recommend Novo to anyone.\n",
            " - Their customer care is complete crap. You will not be able to ever get anyone on the phone and it takes them days to respond on the app.  If you dispute a charge, they have 120 days to reconcile it. During that time they are not issue a temporary credit nor anything other than assuring you they are allowed to have 120 days over and over.  I think I was told that 15 times in my dispute is still not over. It has been over 100 days though.  So I guess they are allowed a few more according to this guy. When I asked to speak to the manager, she also assured me they are allowed 120 days. Cool  that literally did nothing for me. I will not be recommending this to any of my colleagues anymore. It is not worth the Stripe for nonprofit discount. It’s a crap service. I will be closing my account after they issue the credit that I should’ve received three months ago.\n",
            " - I have been a Novo business customer for about 20 months and use the account to manage the financial transactions for my Amazon business. One thing that's been a thorn in my side is their lack of phone or live chat support. If you have an urgent situation, you can send them a message or email and they'll get back to you within 24 hours. Another thing I have noticed lately is that when I send Express ACH payments, the payments are not being deposited to the recipients' accounts by the time Novo agreed to. It makes me wonder if they are just pocketing the extra fee I pay for Express service. Another issue is, they don't provide an official transaction receipt when sending payments, just an email saying you sent a payment. These three issues converged today to create a pretty bad situation for us. I have some imported cargo in a warhouse at the port ready to be picked up. I paid all of the warehouse's charges yesterday by ACH Express so that the cargo could be released to the trucking company today. Novo's guarantee was, the funds would be available by 1:00 PM today. The driver showed up in the morning to pick up the cargo, but the warehouse said our payment had not arrived so the driver waited several hours. At 1:00 PM their time, the funds still had not been received. An hour later, still not. Now, we're probably going to be charged additional charges by both the trucking company and the warehouse. (The account numbers we used were correct as we have made previous successful payments to the same account). I sent off messages to Novo customer support hours ago and have not heard anything back. As of this writing, Novo customer service reps are off the clock and probably enjoying their free time. Meanwhile, our cargo remains on hold, situation unresolved.In summary, Novo's lack of customer support has finally come around to bite me in a big way. I highly recommend avoiding this pseudo-bank (Not being sarcastic, Novo is a fintech, not an actual bank).UPDATE (09/28/2023): Response to Novo: The name of the business on the account is Brown De Lira LLC. And, just FYI, I submitted three support requests yesterday (by internet, iphone app, and email), the first at 3:22 PM CST. It is now, 24 hours later and I have not yet received a response.\n",
            " - It took a while to figure out how to add money to the account without linking a deposit as this was my first time using and I wanted to know I could trust the bank first. This has been the worst experience!!!! After transferring money to the account I tried to use my card. The transaction was declined, when I checked my Novo app it was because the card was deactivated. I tried to transfer my money out of the account and that was also declined stating the account was closed. This was an hour after putting money into this account. I contacted the fraud department, as that was the only phone number available, all to be told it was under review by the accounts team that I couldn’t be transferred to, and that there was no time line on when this would be resolved. At this point it’s been over a week, my account is closed, but they won’t give me my money back. They are freezing my funds, which they are making interest off of everyday, but I have no access to MY money. Even with the account being closed they still will not give me a timeframe as to when they will give me back money. Novo is a fraud they will steal your moneyI have a complaint filed with the BBB and mine is just one of many against NovoThey need to be shut downThey should never be allowed to froze our money without explanation and refuse to give it backDONT EVER BANK WITH NOVO BUSINESS BANKING\n",
            " - Edit: I did not receive a response about my dispute inquiry until I posted a review here on trustpilot.

In addition, a representative commented on this review and said that an agent has responded to my inquiry yet the response was irrelevant to the action items I requested. I asked specifically, to speak on the phone to someone who is apart of the dispute team to outline the criteria for a valid dispute, their reply 1. was not a phone call as I requested, and 2. Was unspecific and did not address the fact that there was an unauthorized transaction on my account. As I've stated before this edit, this is irresponsible platform and should not be able to function as a financial organization or company. Their ability to be considered a financial platform should be revoked. I've banked with Novo for a bit now and haven't really had any issues as nothing I was doing required any contact with their staff. Recently, my wallet was stolen and in turn my NOVO debit card was used to make unauthorized transactions. Not only, did they allow a large purchase without the requirement of my pin number, when I submitted a claim that identified the transaction as unauthorized they canceled my dispute with no explanation. I requested to speak with someone over the phone various times and no one has contacted me or even responded via text or email. Truly poor management and a irresponsible financial platform. I recommend using a business account with a larger financial institution with a proven track record of handling their customers' situations with care. They also hire people for positive reviews.\n",
            " - Terrible fraud protection. No calls, no texts, no emails for suspicious activity. And then they give themselves 120 days to decide if they’re going to give you your money back. 4 months!? My cards were all stolen and someone spent $3,500 on my novo card in 8 different instances within minutes of each other and this didn’t seem suspicious to them. They said because it was used in the town where i live it didn’t seem suspicious so fraud wouldn’t have been alerted. That’s absurd. My other cards that were stolen and used all alerted me and declined and one other one that they got to work has already refunded the fraud claims and it’s all been settled. But not novo. I will be closing this account the day i get my money back. There is nothing they could do to convince me to stay\n",

            " - From July 15 to July 19, 2023 Novo completely failed to detect a series of SEVENTY-TWO fraudulent transactions which occurred on a debit card number that Novo stated was \"inactive.\"  The \"inactive\" status was due to Novo switching debit card providers and sending all Novo customers a new debit card.  They sent out letters stating the old debit cards would be inactive as of June 30, 2023 and customers should begin using the new cards by this date because any transactions attempted on the old cards would be declined. Yet, Novo failed to un-link the old card from my account and a hacker was able to process SEVENTY-TWO transactions on that old card from July 15 to July 19 2023, which caused me to lose over $2000.  I am a small business owner and this has REALLY impacted my business in a negative way!!I have been in the dispute process with Novo since July 19, 2023 and nothing has come of it.  I have followed all of the ridiculous steps they've requested, including spending 5 hours of my time to dispute each of the 72 fraudulent transactions SEPARATELY through their app.  So ridiculous.  No one on their customer service line can help.  They have a script and only read what's written on there, no matter what the actual request from the customer might be.  Bottom line -- I DO NOT RECOMMEND NOVO.  Terrible fin tech company with incompetent fraud monitoring and operations systems.\n",

            " - My business has had an account with Novo for over a year now and it has been a really great experience. Although, I haven’t had to reach out to customer service and cannot speak to resolving any issues through them. Leaving 4/5 stars is in response to a dispute I filed in April. There was a double withdrawal logged while I was traveling abroad. I had withdrawn the maximum daily ATM amount, which is locally imposed, not a restriction by NOVO.  This means a second withdrawal would’ve been illegal and impossible from the same ATM. The transaction review took 3 months and the only detail in the message I received was that the investigation concluded/determined there would be no return of funds and that the decision was final. I’ve asked for details with no answer.\n",

This is what the app showed. This number jumped to $9,555.00 due suddenly without any further draws being made. We questioned the company and they said their app was displaying incorrect information and we did owe the $10,000.00. We paid that to pay it off but now we don't know if the $0 due is correct either because they say their statements are the only thing that can be trusted. But those are always a month behind. Yes, you read that correctly. The app glitches and information it displays can't be trusted. What's the one thing we all need in a banking app? We need to be able to trust that the numbers it shows are added up and displayed correctly. We will make a change to another more well known bank by the end of the year. We really liked Novo up until now. All they offered was an apology. At least our 401K company offered a gift card when they messed up our withdrawals.\n",
            " - This company is a scam online bank.   There is no customer support.  If you call you get a call center room full of kids probably making less than minimum wage with a script to say to customers.   I had my debit card stolen and used to make charges.  900 dollars worth prior to me being able to figure out the cheap horrible app and freeze the card.   The person using the card made 7 more attempts to charge things over the next few days.   I filed a police report, have proof I was no where near these stores when charges were made.   I've filed over 30 \"support tickets\" and have never gotten a phone call.  I only got a reply that they have 120 days to investigate.   At 115 days I got a message on the app that unfortunately they will not refund my money.   This is against the law as a federally backed bank has to refund stolen or fraud charges to their customers.   DO NOT USE THIS ONLINE BANK\n",

I gave it a couple of days and decided to reach out to support. I am now being told my account is being investigated, and that they can't provide me with literally ANY further information on when it will be completed nor for the reason. Not even when I called! I was told eventually that it was for security purposes. Why didn't I get any notifications about this?! My money I used to fund the account, is being held hostage.

            " - Novo seemed like a good idea at the time as we wanted to quickly get up a business account that wasn't going to require credit checks. They worked with Strip. Even Zen business mentioned them.Upon getting with them, their invoice process seemed just fine. Super easy and loved it. Im feeling great about Novo at this point and thinking, \"right on this can work\".Then the pain-points started. Upon mobile depositing checks from my vendors it would take 3-5 days for NOVO to acknowledge it. THEN....it was take another 3-4 days for it to process and post it. THEN...even when I hit INSTANT TRANSFER (of course they charge a fee...and I get it) But THAT would take 2 days. For my business to run fluid it was just not an option. I tried ACH instead. Looked all over NOVO to find Express ACH which was supposed to make things happen quicker in receiving money (with a fee and thats ok I get it) but you couldn't even find it. Customer Service? Forget it. No people, some bots, and \"help\" articles. But no action. They post that one day they will have a better app. And thats been up for a while. Did they \"steal money from me\" or \"shut down my account\"? No. But their process is absolute garbage and their customer service is a dumpster fire beyond that. Just NOT a good choice for us. We are heading back to brick and mortar like we should've. But man did they cost me some credibility in my industry. Thankfully, I communicated well with my team, but I know others who weren't so fortunate. STAY AWAY FROM NOVO!\n",

Don't waste your time or money with a business account with these jokers. We had a fradulant charge on our card and they are refusing to resolve it. They are claiming it could take up to 120 DAYS!.

I used to work in banking and it shouldn't take that long especially for checks under $5,000.  I know you can pay to have have express pay, but certainly is not worth paying the fee to do that.

I called customer service and spoke with Shawana who was extremely nice and compassionate. Great customer service by the way! She explained it was no fault of my own that the charges were pending and it was internal issues which their IT department has been trying to correct. My problem is my account has been in the negative $1212 but I have an available balance of $188. However, my card was frozen and I have been unable to use it for 27 days. My business deposits are being held up as a result and I am currently stuck at the Airport as I write this trying to figure out another way to rent a vehicle if at all possible considering I only travel with this particular card and cash. I cannot begin to explain the problems this has caused and what’s more upsetting is it’s not the first time or the only issue I have been having with this company. My previous card chip stop working for no reason and deposits made took over three weeks to show up and become available. I’ve been super patient with this company but at this point I feel it’s probably not the best fit for me considering I am constantly traveling for my business and I rely heavily on being able to use this card. Needless to say, I am not happy and super disappointed. I hate writing reviews like this because as a business owner I understand how bad reviews can be damaging but I just wanted to be transparent and honest so individuals searching for an account for their business would have all the information they need before selecting this company. Novo you really need to do better.\n",
            " - I had problems invoicing a client where they kept receiving an error message. I opened a ticket, they responded 4 days later with some suggestions. My client tried different payment methods & her account was good. She's paid an invoice before with me. I canceled that invoice and sent a new one. Same issue. Every time I responded back to Novo's Customer Service, I was told it was being escalated and someone would be in touch. Nothing. I had to keep doing follow-ups. But no one ever reached out to me. Went through this over a month and I finally got frustrated and transferred my money and opened an account elsewhere. I am running a business and not being able to invoice my clients is a huge issue, not to mention, the horrible customer service I received with no follow-ups or the matter being resolved. Unacceptable! And when I professionally told them that I was very disappointed in their customer service and how myself and my business was being treated, they acted like they didn't care. Extremely disappointed. Very poor customer service.\n",

It has been a month since this happened, I have heard from novo once and was told to dispute each transaction and to be patient. The only updates I’ve gotten since are email reminders to follow up with the last support message so their investigation can proceed. The message they are waiting for me to reply to is from an ai bot telling me they are investigating and to be patient, it should only take 120 days. Meanwhile, my business can’t function because we can’t process payments or pay bills. Horribly misleading. Thanks novo.\n",
            " - Most of the time, Novo is great. It's easy to use on desktop and mobile, no complaints. But every now and then, something goes wrong, and I submit multiple C/S inquiries, and the issue never gets resolved. Waiting months for a resolution affects how I reconcile my accounts at the end of each month. For this reason, I plan on zero-ing out my account and going with another bank. This has happened twice in the last year, and I can't have accounting issues.\n",
            " - I thought Novo sounded great because it didn't charge fees, and it doesn't. What is does do is to hold on to your money. That wouldn't be a problem if I ran a big business, but I run a counseling practice and I am dependent on clients paying fees. My profit margin is thin, and I need to be able to pay bills on time. I can't afford for money transfers to routinely take five days. The credit card processor associated with Novo did the same thing, so financial transactions took forever. I had almost left my traditional bank, but I have returned, and I am much happier.\n",

THEY GAVE BACK SOME OF MY MONEY BUT FOR SOME REASON NOT ALL OF IT. THEY MADE ME WAIT OVER 120 DAYS BEFORE INFORMING ME THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME THE OTHER PART. THIS ALL STARTED IN MARCH 2023.

            " - Support can't help.I used Novo account to run my business. First off, the physical debit card did not arrive for me, it took a whole month! I used a virtual card that has small limits. Then they blocked my account altogether without telling me anything about it. My virtual card was no longer accepted, and bank transfers were also unavailable. Calling the phone did not help anything, the operator did not answer anything because he does not know and will not find out. They are doing an investigation, wait for it. Wait for what? How long do I have to wait? I sent several emails to their email where I got the same response. Novo support will not help you in any way! My money (over 20 thousand dollars) is just stuck in their account. I plan to take legal action if they don't resolve this in the next few days.\n",
            " - Novo has knowledgeable and courteous customer service. I got help from Karen that went out of her way and helped me to sort out an issue i was having with an international wire sent to my account.\n",
            " - Novo experience has been great until I ran into an issue of seeing an unauthorized charge on my account. I have caught the charges the next business day and have reported them appropriately. Without much consideration from the customer service, I was informed that “it’s been over 24 hours and they can’t do anything about it.” I let that go. Next months the same situation occurs- I get the charge from the same vendor, that I do NOT recognize and can’t track down, report it once again and being told the exact same thing that it’s been over 24 hours! I literally caught both of them the NEXT day!! And what respectful institution  gives their customers 24 hours to catch suspicious activity anyway?? I tried calling and escalating the issue, to only be told “contact the merchant and stop the charges.” I WOULD if I COULD!! The whole point is that I can’t track it down and they won’t help me either! Then i was offered a solution to fill out a form to stop the charge for the next month, but only able to do it ONCE!!! So I guess, according to Novo, I should be charged monthly for the rest of my life for something I don’t even know about or watch my account 24/7! Thanks Novo for caring about your customers! I am switching to a different bank!\n",
            " - There are a lot of things wrong with Novo. They take a long time to send out your checks and to approve your deposits. This is the worst thing. If you need money available quickly or to make sure someone gets paid on time, don’t count on Novo. They have no phone-based customer support. At least some of the app integrations do not work—PayPal definitely doesn’t. They have a weird limit increase request system such that if you have one larger check—like a payment for a big job—you can’t just deposit it without requesting the ability to deposit it. You should also know that Novo is not actually a bank. It is an interface and the money is actually held by Middlesex Savings Bank. But you can’t call Middlesex if you have a problem.\n",
            " - When I signed up I received a black debit card. But after about a year I was then mailed a \"new\" white debit card, and was told that my black debit card was being phased out. Figured it was no big deal...except now when I want to transfer money using sites like Venmo, my card is now listed as a CREDIT card, and subject to 3% charges. Not happy about that sleight of hand AT ALL!\n",
            " - I was misinformed about the time for ACH deposits and a representative told me on the phone he did not know where my money was after it was received by the bank but not in my account. Greater transparency and management of funds is needed. It took numerous calls to customer service to get a clear answer and resolution to this issue.\n",
            " - Completely unacceptable customer service. My business partner and wife's card was declining purchases so I made a phone call to customer service. Mind you this is my business and account... I was trying to get the situation resolved and after setting on hold for quite a while. I was eventually told that they could not discuss the account with me. We have opted to take our business elsewhere after this situation as it was not the first time our cards were randomly declining and various places even with money available.\n",
            " - I usually never give 5 stars because no one is perfect but i have to say that Novo is as close as I’ve seen. I’ve never had a problem that they didn’t take care of right away. And follow up with later to ensure it was ok. I like them so much i stopped using my Credit Union. This occasion i clarity on an email i got. Response was next day and completely answered all my questions but if not there’s a reply section to get more help on the sane issue\n",
            " - Although I didn’t have the proper information when I began the process, the Novo team was patient on requesting the proper docs and my account was opened almost immediately after receiving them.\n",
            " - Typically in business transactions, you can prioritize either quality, service, or price. As a dedicated customer of Novo Bank for more than two years, I can now confidently say that you will only receive low cost. Novo Bank offers a convenient and affordable solution for small businesses to operate. However, as your transaction volume increases to more than 20-30 per month, caution is advised. For the second time this year, I have encountered a missing transaction in my account records. Specifically, a transaction of $2.4K was invoiced on 3 July and despite providing them with the trace and sequence number from the sending bank, Novo Bank cannot seem to locate it. They have been investigating my case for three business days but have not provided any feedback other than requesting additional information. What exacerbates the situation is the feeling of being ignored, as my calls go straight to voicemail and the only option is to leave a message, along with your email so they don’t have to speak with you. It appears that my number has been flagged, and they have refrained from providing a communication via phone. If you are starting a business, I strongly advise against choosing Novo Bank. Research and find a better alternative, as this inexpensive option may ultimately lead to heartache.\n",
            " - Never received my card so i contacted support and still never got a replacement even though they said they were sending one out.\n",
            " - When no bank wanted to open a business account for me, Novo stepped in and took care of me by opening a small business account.\n",
            " - Highly do NOT recommend for businesses!  My connected stripe account made a deposit into my account on Wednesday 7/12/2023.  As of 7/15/2023 that deposit has yet to clear or be available in my account on Saturday.  The APP says its available, but all my purchases and even attempts to withdraw from an ATM have been declined.  I have called and left several messages that have not been returned!  I called in TWICE again yesterday and spoken to two people.  The recurring theme is one can help. I even asked to have the \"expedited\" transfer fee waived to gain access to my funds and they DECLINED to honor that request just a quick and they decline for me to have any access to well over $1K in deposits.  At this point I have to co-mingle my funds and pay my business bills with my personal account which is an accountants nightmare.  Go figure!How embarrassing as a business owner to attempt to pay bills and appear indigent simply because the auto debits won't work.  I am locked out of my CRM as a result and face loosing more money without access to my business tools. I have opened several chats and no one has followed up with an answer.  I opened another request which they closed and said:  \"Our system post transactions slower than other banks, please use the first support ticket\" Said support ticket has been open since 7/12/2023 and the last response from that original request was on 7/13/2023 with no response to my follow up questions or text and no indication that they are doing ANYTHING to assist me.  I have 5 calls and 3 closed chats, it's been 72 hours and now its a weekend.  Still no access to money.  No offer to compensate me for the inconvenience of not having access to my funds through no error of my own, no follow up from the open support ticket.  Small Business Owners - BEWARE and put your money elsewhere!  They were MID at best until they weren't and while mistakes happen, the ability to assist and reassure me as a client and small business owner has failed miserably.  I suggest anyone with money here move it expeditiously because if their system fails there is 0 accountability on their behalf and they move SLOWER than the IRS to resolve their own issues.  As an accountant/developer who tried a new bank for a venture spin off, don't waste your time here.\n",
            " - Used Novo for about a year. Customer service is terrible, and worse, they will close your account for seemingly no reason at all with no notification, as they did to me. All your records and data will not be recoverable.Stay away from this garbage fintech bank and use a real bank that actually complies with federal banking regulations.Edit for Novo: Not disclosing my personal information in a public review. Already went through customer service about this matter and was completely brushed off. If you actually care to resolve this matter, you can contact me at 0_severer.grafts(at)icloud.com and I will update this review for all to see if you actually reach out and make things right. Otherwise, I hope more small businesses wake up to your grifting.\n",
            " - I was told that I could only get help via email until my account was opened.  The issue was that the submit function on the application was not working with no indication of what was standing in the way.  It is difficult to wait hours (or days initially because I made the mistake of applying on a Friday) in between emails just to be told to finish the application.  There was nothing on my end indicating that something was missing. That was the only help they were offering so I needed to move on to another provider.\n",

            " - UPDATE on 7/17/23- I gave you the name of my company and have not heard from you. I just got off the phone with the merchant's credit card processing company and was told the funds are being held and that my bank NOVO/Middlesex Fed needs to issue a chargeback and the funds will be returned to me. This is what most banks do, so why are we now well over 70 days into this with nothing but \"we have 120 days to complete our investigation\"? I would like all of the funds that were stolen out of my account returned immediately. The merchant has verified the charges were not legitimate, as has theircredit card processing company so what is taking NOVO so long? Something doesn't add up. On Friday, April 21, 2023, I had two fraudulent charges withdrawn from my NOVO account. Both were to a company called C******Y TRAVEL in the amounts of $2,000.00 and $2,783.00 for a total of $4,783.00. I first saw that these charges were pending on the morning of Saturday, April 22, 2023, and immediately tried to reach out to NOVO bank. This bank is an online bank and there is not a number to be called. I filled out the dispute online, however, unless you upload paperwork/proof, you cannot complete a dispute online. Since I did not make or authorize these charges or know who this company was, I had nothing to upload. I ended up preparing a statement on a document and uploaded that so that I could submit a dispute with them online. I also tried calling the number on the back of my card and got a message that they were not in on the weekend and to leave a message, which I did. I searched online and came across this site https: //investorjunkie. com/ reviews/ novo and read several reviews about this company that were similar to mine. I started to panic, as this is a lot of money to me, and I could not afford to not recover it. I researched online and found a number that I called to Middlesex Federal Savings Bank (the bank Novo banks through) and got a live person who took my dispute information. They asked if I had contacted the company (Colony Travel). I told them I had not as I had no idea who they were. I was told that the charges would not be put back into my account while the investigation was complete, and that it could take up to 120 days. After we hung up, I googled Colony Travel and found two. The first one I called did not take credit cards. The second one I found did not answer, so I sent an email and followed up with a call to them the first thing Monday morning. I spoke with Heidi XXXXX, the co-owner of the company. It is a 2-person operation with she and her husband. She did not recognize the charges and I asked her to send me something in writing. I didn’t hear back for a day or so and called her again on Wed the 26th of April. She said she was contacted by the merchant and that the payments were still on hold and had not been cleared. We both thought this was great news since neither one of us had authorized these payments, and we were in agreement that hopefully this would be resolved shortly. She sent me an email stating that Colony Travel did not generate these charges to my account, but in speaking with their merchant account managers, they had determined that someone did.  I sent all of this information to NOVO and waited. Still nothing. The only way I can communicate with them is through their online support app. I have tried to call Middlesex Federal Savings again and have been told I need to deal directly with NOVO and that Middlesex Federal Savings cannot do anything to help me. It's been 69 days and no word, no refund. I just spoke with the travel agency and the money has been taken out of their account too, with no recent update or refund. BEWARE of NOVO. Go to a bank who will credit YOUR funds back into your account while the investigation is ongoing. Most reputable businesses operate this way. Texas Preferred Prop\n",

            " - Trying to create a yelp page for this DIGITAL ONLY \"BANK\"I have also filed complaint on this company with fdic.I opened a novo bank account back at the end of 2022. Things seemed ok and I would contact support and i would get responses pretty quick.  I deposited a 10k check and no issues, especially while i was contemplating depositing to my wells fargo business account. After that hiccups started to arrise with their team in customer support. They became very unprofessional by giving robotic responses. Basically copying and pasting their responses from a script. I wound up going to an atm and using the bank card and never had an issue with an atm until may 23rd 2023. I attempted withdraw a 70$ from ATM and the ATM jammed at bank of America not giving me my 70$ request. This has happened in the past once or twice with my other banking experiences however it would get resolved within a few days if not a day. But here is NOVO BANK WITH 4.5 STARS ACROSS THE BOARD WHERE REVIEWS ARENT MONITORED. With their \"click the wheel to dispute transactions\" then closing chat transcrip. A montg later there isnt a dispute and i have to wait 120 days for response. Why the month wait? Because there was no way to get a person to respond as their chat bot was stuck on providing articles that dont explain why there isnt a live agent online as they promised. Chime banking systems seem more ligit as most of my workers are telling me chime is better.(they dont understand how business banking works) .I can talk about the lack of investigation on a 2k ach but their respons was, \"theres no way to get it back beyond 48 hours\". A dispute for a item never recieved for 249$ was not investigated and turned into another loss. Im typing this out of anger and frustration so please forgive my grammer and punctuation. Ive created their yelp page as they have so many 5 star reviews on platforms that arent monitoring their reviews. I am pretty sure the 2.5 star on google will need a better platform like yelp to help guide consumers and commercial consumers on business banking and other needs.\n",
            " - I love Novo Bank.  They are always on top of customer service and their services are awesome for my small business.I especially love the dual credit card.  I have my physical card in AppleWallet and turn it on and off when I need to use it.  The virtual card in not listed in my AppleWallet to keep it secure.  I pay all of my recurring bills with this card.  With 2FA & biometrics needed to get into my iPhone & AppleWallet, I am very secure.\n",
            " - The app is easy to use. Only issue I've had is card related. My understanding is the card issuing department seems to be behind schedule. Still waiting on the business debit card.\n",
            " - Two months in a row, I've deposited a check and it just vanished for at least 24 hours each time. Not in activity history, not pending...just missing. When I wrote in about this I was told there is a four-day hold...and that hold is not based on when you deposit the check. What? So many things are wrong with that.Customer service is in-app only. It's mostly automated, very slow, and if they are real people -- they are happy to lie. Two months running, I was promised my funds would be available by a certain day and time and they were not. This is terrible practice and service. I will be closing my novo account.I don't mind banking online and I needed business checking with no fees and no minimum balance requirements. Novo meets those two, so that's why it's two stars and not just one.\n",
            " - Please STAY AWAY!!!The customer service is TERRIBLE! They don't allow you to speak with anyone over the phone, and redirect you to the support chat via the app. However, the support chat is just FAQs, with automatic responses.Please save your time, money, and peace of mind and stay away from this company!Most of the good reviews are just paid reviewers, don't be swindled!\n",
            " - The concept is great, their app is really nice. However; if you experience issues good luck getting a human response. We endorsed a check for deposit, signed and wrote exactly what was needed. They said it wasn't endorsed, so we wrote the endorsement darker, they then said it was altered and rejected it.No one will give you a response except, read our Mobile Deposit Terms & Conditions. No one could explain why the first check was rejected. They also don't ask for your personal address at opening, instead you submit the front copy of your driver's license... which they use the address on that to ship your debit card.. however if you have an address on the back of your driver's license they wouldn't know.. frustrating to learn.In short, great idea, had high hopes, but the customer service fell short.\n",
            " - Zero stars wasn't an optionI run a small business and have used NOVO for a couple years. Recently, I have have ~2500 removed from my account by someone with a digital credit card in another state (Police was able to get image).  Its been ~30days and Novo has not returned the funds inspite of knowing that the charges were fradulent.  Funds was removed from a Target in New York in multiple transactions, seven of them, same amounts, same time frame.  But no alarm went off if their fraud department.My advice, DO NOT USE NOVO.  When I called middlsex today, it seems they get alot of calls about NOVO but are not allowed to view accouts or even help.  The only option for help is email novo support or request help through the support app (no phone number). Stay away, they are a Fintech orgalization, not a bank. So they have fewer requirements/guidlines and it shows.I have moved all of my busines to BoA.\n",
            " - Stay away from this bank. The dashboard of money in and out is not user friendly. I had a purchase that double authorized on 4/26 and over $500 is still pending in my account and I do not have access to it. I went through the customer service app as instructed and all I have been told in almost 2 months is that it is a technical issue they are investigating. Now it has been over 2 weeks since anyone has responded to my request for an update or resolution to get my money released to my account. You can't call and speak to anyone in real time and you can't expect timely responses from the app chat and although I have asked multiple times for my ticket to be escalated as this is my money that is tied up in their technical issue, my request goes ignored. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere because this company does not care at all about it's customers or their need for answers and access to funds at the speed of business.\n",

            " - It's too bad there isn't a 0 star.I attempted to withdraw cash from a local ATM (also my local credit union) using my Novo business debit card almost 10 days ago. I made 2 transaction attempts, and both were denied even though I had more than enough money in my business account to cover the withdrawals.I checked my balance on the Novo app and the money was deducted from my account but not reinstated. When I reached out to Novo via their customer service app, it was 1.5 days before anyone replied. Once I received a reply, they gave me an elongated response on how to file a complaint. Now why should I, the customer, have to go through an elongated process to recover my money? Anyway, I looked at their instructions and it said to dispute the transactions, go to a transaction, click on the \"wheel\" in the upper right (it's supposed to look like a settings button), but there wasn't one for either of the transactions so I couldn't complete the dispute steps. Then I asked for their customer service number ... which they don't readily give out on the app or online.I called customer service and my wait time was over 10 minutes despite the initial auto-reply telling me I had an approximate 2-minute wait. Once I talked to someone, I could barely understand her and the background noise was ridiculously loud. She told me they filed for an investigation and it could take up to 120 days to resolve the issue. There was no willingness to issue me a credit during the investigation so I could access my needed funds.I am absolutely frustrated with Novo. This is banking gone bad in the worst sense. Now I am in contact with my local credit union and they are researching the situation. They own the ATM, so they are essentially the merchant and can deep-dive into the transactions from 2 weeks ago. Doesn't really look like this problem is stemming from me or the credit union. I think it's very clear where the problem is stemming from here.Want to start a small business banking account with Novo? Don't do it. I really wish I wouldn't have. Now I'm short cash and have to switch business accounts elsewhere. Novo one is staying open until my cash is recovered. Hopefully it will be. :(\n",
            " - Novo is a prime example of what happens when Fintechs go horribly wrong.  The onboarding process was pretty straight forward - including multiple requests to verify my identity and home address.  That's when things turned weird:  they mailed a Business Debit card for my account to some random address by accident.  Somehow despite multiple documents showing my actual address, their team put someone else's address on the account.  Support was none too interested in fixing this until I finally got someone to change the address and re-send the card.Later, I'd come to realize their customer service is all off-shore through Zendesk.  Getting a human here in the states that's actually associated with Novo is impossible.  Emails sent to me with erroneous information about promos for setting up payment processing were just shrugged off after asking for WEEKS for an answer.I wouldn't trust Novo with even a dollar.  A few minutes of research showed a rash of other consumer complaints and even regulatory action taken against this Fintech.UPDATE:  Their response is always \"go to the app\" so you can get a reply that asks you what is wrong, even though the ticket shows exactly what the issue is.  These people have ZERO idea what they're doing and WILL make costly mistakes that LOSE YOUR MONEY.\n",

Do you really want that?\n",
            " - DON'T BELIEVE THE \"GREAT REVIEWS\" ABOUT NOVO. When there is an avalanche of \"1 Star\" Reviews and complaints, it says something when, at the same time, in a short span of time (within a few days), there are an exorbitant amount of \"5 Star\" Reviews. More people are inclined to share their upset than to share their \"great experience\"...so what is up with that?! I had a Novo Business Debit card for only a few months. I never used the card and it never left my house and the card number was used fraudulently with bogus charges. Either Novo was hacked or they are selling my info (including my debit card number), as there is no other way that I was the victim of these fraudulent charges. After many phone calls, I got my money back, but not without a lot of hassle. As others have stated, if you have an issue or questions, you have to deal with bots. If you call their outsourced call center, they pretty much can't do anything other than be there to answer a phone call. They sent me a new card... this time with no customer service phone number on the back. So if you want to reach out to customer service for even a placebo effect, you can't because there is no phone number on the new card and also not on their website... just a chat with a bot who can't think outside the \"bot box\". I'm trying to delete my info from their system and close my account (so hopefully no further damage to my private information) is also very time consuming... still working on it! Bot Bank.\n",
            " - This is a terrible bank! Please be careful, I am currently dealing with a deposit I transferred into my account from chase and am STILL trying to get anyone from customer service to help me! They refuse to take the pending status off after 18 business days and 3 weeks even though the policy and procedures states a max of 5 business days after it as been received in the account.  I am getting the run around and can’t even close my account with a pending balance even though it’s positive and no transactions for 2 weeks! I wish I never opened a novo account, I can’t get anyone to answer the phone number that I finally got from the person I was emailing with from support and that took 3 days to just get the number that no one answers.Updated response to novo: Their reply just said that they have no idea how to fix it and they are escalating it after it was escalated Monday June 5th and it took a week for them to ask me to confirm the transaction twice and now to say they can’t help. It has now been 20 days that novo has had 234.95 pending without helping me or giving me any reason to justify this outrageous hold that has lasted longer than the standard 5 business days that regulaction CC legally states is standard.  I have not received any valid reason as to why and I can’t even get anyone to respond to anything and when I finally do it is to tell me they can’t help me. Will I ever get my money back?\n",
            " - We are a nonprofit organization with a 7-figure annual budget.  I went looking for an online bank because we have no brick-and-mortar locations.  After comparing other options, Novo emerged as a good choice for nonprofits based on reviews, primarily.  Unfortunately, it has been a frustrating and disappointing experience being their customer, and we have since established an account at a major bank.  The number one problem is that you can't speak to a person on the phone. You have to submit a support ticket through the app or via email, and it has taken anywhere from a couple of hours to a day-and-a-half to get a response.  When you're trying to conduct business, this lag time makes it very difficult.  Plus, when they finally answer your first inquiry, they often ask the exact same question you posited in the first contact, so you have to repeat yourself and then wait ANOTHER couple of hours or days to get your response.  And then its a crap shoot as to whether they can fix your problem.  Oh, and they aren't available on weekends or after 6pm ET.  In short, the slow responsiveness, plus ridiculously low ($5K) daily limits on the BUSINESS debit card (no matter how much money you have in the account) and other difficult restrictions made it impossible for us to keep our money with Novo.\n",

            " - I am an independent contractor (speech pathologist) that opened a Novo business account. I attempted to deposit 2 JP Morgan payroll checks from a large school district that I am contracting with. Novo accused me of submitting fraudulent checks. I provided them with my pay check stubs and reference numbers  to prove the checks were good. They then stated I was a \"high risk\" and abruptly closed my account. A speech therapist that works with autistic children in the schools is high risk??? This account closing caused so many issues as a small business owner and none of this made sense. Then I realized the fraudulent check claim, immediate closing of my account and comment that I was \"high risk\" came the day after I verified my account with my drivers license and selfie. I guess being brown is a red flag to Novo. I will be reporting this incident to the Federal Reserve Board.\n",
            " - One of my clients sent a money wire to my Novo account. It was early afternoon on a Friday. I wanted to transfer the fully available funds to my personal Ally account to pay some bills. Novo is not part of Zelle and doesn't have \"instant\" transfers. So I opt for an \"express ACH\" transfer, which the bank said I had an open window for \"same day\" availability. I paid the fee and set the transfer in motion. At the time the ACH transfer was supposed to show up, it didn't. It did not show up until the following Monday, which is when a regular ACH transfer would have shown up. I was not happy. I messaged their customer service to tell them what happened and asked for the express fee to be refunded since I did not get what I paid for. Four canned responses later and they have refused to issue a refund. I've been waiting three days for their \"team\" to evaluate the situation. To anyone using Novo, never expect great customer service, and never use their express ACH option. It's a waste of money.\n",
            " - I've had a Novo account for a while now, I actually have two for both of my companies. While it's a great option for a quick business account that you can open fairly quickly, without any major requirements, the customer service is poor poor poor at best. You will wait days before receiving a response via the app or email. When they do respond, they don't thoroughly address the issue, they just spew information from a script. Poor customer service will be the reason why I close both of my accounts. Oh- and you will wait many days, almost a week before a check will clear. Insane. Good for people starting out but not a good bank for those with higher volume business.\n",
            " - I am going to describe a bunch of issues I had with the bank, and I want to start by saying that I’m not reporting these because I am mad about a one-time issue that was out of their control—like outright fraud. These issues are systemic problems. I don’t think Novo will steal your money, but I bet you won’t like it. To start, the tech is buggy. Only the app is well developed. When using the service in s computer web browser, it sometimes says “an error occurred” and just logs out. But sometimes it says there is an error and logs in anyway. I don’t think it’s s security issue, just bad coding. But it is sort of concerning that a bank has these problems. There have been other bugs too like not being able to make a payment for no clear reason. Customer service is unreliable. In a browser, there is not even a way to submit a support request. The bank does not provide live support after 6 PM Eastern. And, they will only give you a phone number if you express serious concerns—and even then they said that I would have to make most changes myself through the app. Integration with PayPal is impossible—look up online how many people have had problems with this. I haven’t used other apps so maybe those are better. Their policies on holding checks are extremely conservative, and it is not clear why. I am currently waiting 6 days for a corporate check from a large public institution to clear because it was deposited on Tuesday after business hours, and the funds are only available after three full business days—and Monday is a holiday. The 3-full-days rule is extremely conservative. That is really long for a small business. If you never have physical checks, that is only a little better. They still make you wait several days until the funds are available—even for direct deposit. You can’t transfer more than $1250 from an external bank per day, so you will have to make multiple deposits over multiple days to get funds into your account. If you have very simple needs and limited numbers of transactions, this might work for you. But if you have an active business, you will run into problems. If you encounter any hiccups the first week or so, it isn’t a one-time glitch. I would bet the problems will keep happening. So if you think it seems great, maybe open an account with a small amount and see how it goes. I would not make this your primary bank unless you are certain it will work. Oh and also, Novo isn’t really a bank. It’s a web interface, and Middlesex Savings Bank actually does the banking. Seriously. Look it up. It seems weird, right? Again, it isn’t fraud—I don’t think—but basically Novo is a just service that partners with a bank to actually do the transactions. It’s a bad service though. I am going to guess that the Novo people will write a “sorry to hear about your experience” response to this, but I am not asking them for anything so take their response with a grain of salt. I think the problems are systematic issues.\n",
            " - The virtual debit card attached to my bank account  was used in August at a cell phone store in Dubai.  I had never used this virtual card, but someone used it to buy $736.00 worth of merchandise in Dubai.  Novo bank returned the $ to my account, but now 9 months later, they sent an email that their team investigated the transaction and there was no fraud, so they will be taking the $736.00 back out of my account.  I had never used that card, and have never purchased anything in Dubai as I am in the US.  Check their reviews and social media comments.  This has happened to others too.  They have virtually no customer service that can be reached.  Unethical bank.  Stick to a local bank as this bank has unethical business practices.  Don't let Novo take the $ that you've worked for as a small business owner.Reported to the Ohio Attorney General and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n",

            " - Novo bank is withholding our money. First they sent two bank cards that would not activate.  The third card they sent we used once to make a purchase. The very next time we used it for a withdrawal no money came out of the ATM! Every attempt I made to fix this only ended with pre-generated text responses in the app from Lusito N. and Akanksha Srivastava.  No actual person, just a message that it will take 120 days to \"investigate\".  Is it even legal to hold hundreds of dollars of someone else's money?  Even the bank where the attempted transaction took place told us that there was no error in the ATM.  Novo just recorded a payment and deducted it from our account.  No payment was ever made.  It's been almost three weeks and after several messages, I am out of patience. We haven't even had the account for two months yet. This must be a new form of robbery.  I hope the FDIC investigates them.   They should be charged.Update:I just found out that Novo Bank is not an actual bank, it is a fintech, not a bank. Banking services provided by Middlesex Federal Savings F.A.  I already called that bank since Novo doesn't have a phone number and they refused to help me because they are not responsible.\n",

            " - My account has been under review for 3 days apparently its frozen. I deposited a check and i received an automatic email that it was declinedv 1 minute later. I tried again a few times and its a bot responding. I keep getting a copy and pasted response. I need to pay staff and allocate my funds. There is no one to call for urgent matters. I will be switching banks, I tried to transfer my funds to my new bank but it is not letting me. Beware.Is this even legal?\n",
            " - Obvious they could care less about interacting with their customers.First, they have no idea how to usher in new applicants, they just send a single reply to your email and then it's up to you to get that and make the next step. This is a super long process considering they could just be in touch and working 1on1 to get things done in a matter of minutes. If you have any issues with your account there is only a FAQ page and a bot which can only regurgitate FAQ pages. They don't make it easy to find a phone number and call and receive help from staff for the inadequacies of their site. Every major bank would have this; novo is trying to cut corners.If your card is declined, you don't get any report sent to you, and there's no way to contest it or ask them to stop declining your card. This makes it hard to do business. Again, just putting a phone number on the card like every other card I've ever seen in my life would make this so much better.I hate that we need to use a company like this, but we don't have the time to switch gears right now. I'll just buy stuff with my personal card I guess and hope the banking with routing and account number continues to function correctly until we can take the time to ditch these guys.Sad.\n",
            " - Starting to absolutely hate banking here. The transactions are so slow to update and reflect on the dashboard. Why did i need a new debit card? Doesn’t work well with Apple Pay. Can’t deposit more than $200. I mean the list goes on. I’ll be moving banks soon.\n",
            " - I've been a customer for over a year and had no issues until recently. They closed my account without notice yet I was still able to integrate other financial sources to it. They never notified me of the closing of my account, won't respond to my emails, and issued a new debit card without my consent. The customer service is terrible! What they've done to my account doesn't match up with any emails they've sent. They don't have a phone number so you'll never get help from an actual person. It has been a headache.\n",
            " - It's been 2 months since opening my Novo account.I've had a weeks long conversation with support about \"unknown device logins\" which I was told to ignore or turn off. No confirmation from Novo but I assume they were coming from the Novo Shopify connection.I still don't have a debit card or virtual debit card to pay suppliers. But I did figure out a glitch that allowed me to see my card number in the app after clicking on a link in the \"your virtual card is ready\" (but it actually wasn't) promo email.Support has closed unresolved tickets on multiple occasions.DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT HERE.Edit: A new agent Novo replied to one of my support tickets as you have seen below. They informed me that virtual cards aren't available for the first 120 days that an account is open. But provided no assistance or acknowledgement of their other shortcomings.Online banking looks tempting, but I'm just going to walk to my local credit union instead.EDIT: 47 days since opening an account, no debit card yet...\n",
            " - Novo is great! I love it as my business bank account. The only thing I don’t like is that they don’t have a customer service number you can readily call for questions, inquiry’s or errors. You have to email them and wait 24 hours for a response which can be troublesome. Other than that, I love it!\n",
            " - I was okay using Novo for about a year but last week suddenly Instagram blocks my ad payments because my card isn’t going through and suddenly I can’t pay my suppliers because the card isn’t working. There’s money on the account and the card is valid until the end of the year so I can’t figure out why Novo was suddenly blocking payments. Tried calling all the customer service lines and when they ask me to input my account number and other information, the system tells me “we don’t recognize your account.” I don’t think I can keep banking here when the customer service is so terrible. Haven’t been able to reach anyone at Middlesex bank either. Support emails don’t answer. I’m not sure what else to do at this point.\n",
            " - Great online platform and easy to use. The only issue I've had was no phone support. If you have an issue with your account, your funds are pretty much frozen until you can speak to someone on the phone. Online support was not helping me with my situation and eventually found a phone number online and connected with a real person to help me.\n",
            " - Ive been hung up on by customer service switch board because no one answered my call. My express ach payment was supposed to hit the external account by 1:30pm est. Its now 2:53pm and nothing has deposited but the funds were sure withdrawn before 8am est. today. And I was told that someone or something at Novo technically didnt even initiate the ach until 8:01 am est. What kind of game are they playing. Their website advertises that if you initiate before 8am est the deposit will hit by 1:30pm est. Novo literally doesnt even post their customer service line on the website or app. And they disclose that Middlesex Federal handles all banking transactions but Middlesex verbally discloses that Novo is responsible for their own dispersments. Do not use Novo, the transactions are never real time updated on the app. Its very hard to keep track of debit transactions. Find an established bank with business account services. Not Novo!!!!\n",
            " - Sent me a new debit card for what seems like absolutely no reason. Now I have to go and change out all of my credentials for all the services I use to run my business. My other card was just fine, wasn't going to expire for 2 more years. Didn't even give me the opportunity to turn down the option of getting a new card. Wasting my time...\n",
            " - I don't like using this bank because you can't talk to a person if you have an issue with your account.\n",
            " - I had novo for the past couple years and have been very pleased with them. That all changed over the past couple weeks when I didn’t receive an updated debit card for one that was expiring. When I did, I just learned that there is a new daily transaction limit of $500. How can someone run a business where you can only use your card for $500 a day. What’s worse is they should’ve communicated that when they issued a new debit card. Moving my money out of there today.\n",
            " - The biggest con is no customer service. I would advice to bank carefully with novo zero urgency banking. Communication is through email ( slow response time) pro is just setting up a small business account that has reserved algorithm in place and clean debt card. I'm still waiting for a response\n",
            " - I used Novo for three years. Everything was fine until I needed to get in touch with them. They force you to email their support email address and wait for a (very slow) response. I had an urgent issue and couldn't do anything about it. I've since closed my account and moved to a different bank.\n",
            " - I have been waiting for my new debit card for a while, it has been a month since my previous expired, and when I called in I was told to apply for a debit card on an app.  I use a landline for my business, how am I supposed to get my new card?????\n",
            " - The reviews that give Novo  4 or 5 stars are not true.  3 to 5 business days for checks to clear is not good for small business. I will use Novo for my stripe transactions but not for check deposits. Check deposits get put on hold automatically and they make you sign the checks for deposit only at Novo Bank so you cannot cancel once you find out that your deposited funds will not be available until a specific date after 3 business days. I will stick with traditional banks or credit union for check deposits.  Most of my customers pay by check. Otherwise Novo is better for CC transactions.\n",
            " - The company really needs to work on there customer support. the fact that I can only speak with someone via the app and have to wait up to 5 days or longer for a response it not ok.\n",
            " - Impossible to get ahold of a representative. I’ve been waiting on a new debit card for 4 months now, can’t close my account because I can’t find anyone to speak with. Extremely frustrating, I’ve had to open a secondary account with a big bank to ensure I actually have a debit card but this has put me in bad situations\n",
            " - Impossible to reach support. Transactions never go through and you cant get in touch except for their app and bot that is totally unhelpful. USE A REAL BANK\n",
            " - I had a concern with my account and was able to leave a message for someone to get back to me. They responded within the hour, it was actual person, and they stayed on the line with me until the problem was resolved. This was also at the end of their work day. They didn't try to rush me off and was very polite. I'm truly enjoying banking with Novo and I have had no complaints thus far.\n",
            " - It took some time but they resolved the issue\n",
            " - Takes too long to cut a check.  Difficult to fund account & limits are terribly low for a business account.  Little support- the chat feature is a joke\n",
            " - Novo is a fantastic company. It has been great for my small business account. No fees, no balance requirements, and super simple to set up and use. It's nice to be out of the grip of the greedy hands of the big banks. I give it only four stars instead of five for two reasons:1. Mobile check deposits take way too long to hit the account. I am currently waiting on a deposit that has taken five days - and is still pending.2. I wish Novo was part of Zelle or another money transfer company. It makes it very difficult to transfer money instantly to other accounts or people. Other than that, Novo is great. My only complaint is the time it takes to get or send money.\n",
            " - Novo is awesome for small business. No hassles, really easy to setup, and everything is super intuitive. My only complaint, which is very minor is that it might take a day or so for charges to reflect in your balance, so you may think you have more money than you really do until it updates. I went on a trip to Hawaii and most of my charges didn't reflect until a few days later. If they are able to make the account balance reflect charges in real time, the platform would be flawless.\n",
            " - It’s all great until you have an issue. Like many others in these reviews, I was pretty smitten with Novo. There are lots of great features and ease of use. In fact, I recently completed a survey of theirs giving glowing reviews. I say this to point out that I’m not a constant complainer and find many of the positive things people have said about Novo to be true. I’ve even recommended Novo to several other small business owners (regrettably). As in all things, if it seems to good to be true, it likely is. In this case, you won’t know that until you have a problem that requires support. TL; DR - Novo is a great bank until you need support. Just like in relationships, you won’t see the full picture until a problem arises. Even if you don’t ever need support, a problem will arise on their part and you will realize that the positive reviews are from people that haven’t had a support encounter.My problem: My original debit card expired on 3/31/23. By 3/31/23 I had not yet received an card and went into to the app to find that the card was \"delayed due to card shortages.\" (???) I was not notified about the delay and was not provided any provisions to get by without a debit card. Essentially, if I didn't reach out to get a new card, it seems no new card was coming. I opened a ticket and was told that a card would be sent rush delivery. This was the best option offered to me and I informed billers that I would update my payment information as soon as the new card was received and scrambled to use personal cards to cover my expenses in the meantime.Today, I received that card and have been unable to activate the card. I was directed to call (844-260-6800) and entered my new card number, I was informed by the automated system that my card could not be activated and to call member services. There was no phone number provided to do so. After finding the number on my own, I spoke to several people and a supervisor via phone support and was repeatedly redirected to the number above, answered by an automated system. Each time I was transferred, the system gave me the same message. I was also told that I needed to bypass the system and talk to a person at that number; however, you can't get to a person if your card number doesn't work! There’s no bypass entry to get to a human. Next, I was told the issue was that my new card was not linked to my account and to call Middlesex Federal Savings. I was redirected there several times and spoke to all branches, as well as any other menu option that would bring me to a person. Every person at Middlesex stated that they have no ability to access Novo accounts and I was redirected back to Novo. By this point, I requested to speak to a supervisor and was told there were none available. I waited 50 minutes on hold for one to become available and spent 20 minutes on the phone with Joseph who told me there was nothing that could be done and continuously referred me back to the automated number and to Middlesex despite my repeated explanations that those avenues have already been tried. Joseph said there were no other managers and no other supervisors. He was unable to provide any direction I should take to get this resolved. Since my debit card is linked to the functions of my business (as one would expect for a business account), the lack of a working debit card has been a real problem. I've had payments declined for autopay business bills every day since 3/31. One of the accounts cancelled a necessary business service because the card was declined more than once over the past several days. After hours of working on this, it’s close of business and I have no working debit card and no response or solution, or timeline from anyone at Novo. The chat has not been answered in hours. No one has told me whether they are working on it or when it will be fixed. The big banks may be monsters, but at least I can always get my money when I need it. They say in relationships you don’t know who someone is until you’ve had a fight/been through hard times. Novo is a perfect fair weather bank. Just hope you don’t ever need a solution for a problem you didn’t cause. Or any support for that matter. So disappointed in Novo.Novo: Since you don't respond to any negative reviews on here in any helpful way and only ask for the business name (in a place where we can't respond). I'll point out that this only proves the unwillingness to reach a solution. You can easily find the business in this case as I submitted the explanation above almost verbatim in my phone and support tickets. I don't need a response here. I need a debit card.\n",
            " - The customer service is a joke and if you have any unauthorized transaction they will say give them 120 days to review then near end of they say they dismiss the claim due to no response to inquiry they made but they don't do anything\n",
            " - I guess my experience is not unique after reading these reviews. My account has been frozen and under review with no explanation as to why when I have literally has no issues negatively on my part. The chat response says the account is under review by their banking partner and all my transactions are declining! WORST BANK EVER! I will spend my weekend finding out who to make a complaint to regarding both NOVO and Middlesex.\n",
            " - Easy process to open account, send invoices and more\n",
            " - Let me say this first, anyone having any issues with this bank, I’d advise you to contact the OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY  report any issues . Also contact THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.I’d strongly advise every small business to avoid this “bank” at all cost. After being with this bank for two years, I should’ve moved my money out of this account and closed the account at the very first red flag that I noticed. 1st red flag: it took over a 3 months to receive a debit card. When I tried to follow up with a representative about my card, I realized soon after they have no live support, No chat support and no customer service number to talk to someone about any questions or concerns you have. 2nd red flag: reading the reviews online, everyone seems to have the same strange issue regarding fraudulent charges randomly being made on the their card while the card is in your possession. I know this is possibly with scammers these days, but it seems that every one is reporting the same issue in the same exact manner. 3rd red flag: novo is not a “bank”. They are a “banking platform”. So this entire time I thought my bank was with novo. Nope …it’s with a small bank called middlesex fed savings in a small town in Massachusetts. So whenever I needed help I’d call the small bank middlesex fed savings to get help and they’d say “sorry we can’t help you. You’d have to contact novo…we are the bank that holds the funds for novo but we can’t help with any customer issues”…. 4th and final red flag: I got txt msgs that a $450 fraudulent charge was made in my card at a grocery store in my city. My card was in my possession. However I called the the fraud dept number on the back of my card and informed the “specialist “ of the fraudulent charge. She said she will cut the card off, open a dispute, and send me another card… over 90 days later. I never got a new card, the dispute was said to been approved an closed back in February after 2 months of sending support tickets through the app, and I was told I’d be getting the funds credited back to my account in 24-48 business hours. Well here we are an additional month and a half later and I never received my money back and there’s no way to reach anyone Because they ignore support tickets through the app. And the actual bank that supports novo never helps… I’d call and they’d say there’s nothing they can do to help. And that I need to keep trying to contact novo through the app or by email. This bank is corrupt and I see a lawsuit coming soon. Anyone having any issues with this bank, I’d advise you to contact OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY to get your money back and report in fund issues . Also contact THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. The more ppl that take these steps , the better. I see this escalating into a big battle.\n",
            " - SKETCHY BANK! DO NOT USE THEM! DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!I was using this bank for my freelancing so I could keep my freelance income separate and keep my taxes in a separate account. I haven't had a problem with them besides insanely long wait times for deposits which sucks but whatever. I recently deposited a hefty check for a long week of work and went through the necessary steps, logged in on the app through my iPhone, confirmed with my email it was my account, and deposited my check. I received a confirmation email about said deposited check (would be available 6 days after my deposit) and sat back to wait. Well, I just was trying to log in just to double-check the deposit and its status, only to find that all of a sudden novo bank does not have my email associated with any account in their system. I tried to reset my password, and still, no email is associated with any account. No way of two-factor authentication or alternate means of accessing the account. I email support and explain what is happening, with a screen shot of the email confirmation of the check (sent to the email address that they said is not associated with a known account) and I haven't gotten a reply from the email to support I sent earlier today. I leave my novo card at home so I didn't have access to their customer support number but I called the number that was listed recently on this website, the Trustpilot reviews, and only got a voicemail that says to email novo support. I am very freaked out, am afraid I either got hacked or that they are collapsing and taking my hard-earned money with them.\n",
            " - Terrible bank. They used to be Ok, but something apparently happened in the last 6-8 months. Customer service close to non-existent. Maybe they are going under ? No phone number listed, no chat capability, all questions are met with the exact same boilerplate answer. Whatever you write is basically ignored by them.What happened to me? Short version, the account stopped functioning. No money in or out. I had gotten most of it out by that point, but then they took my remaining balance and kept it. No explanation for any of the above. That was literally criminal, as I was told by my lawyer. Fortunately legal action got it back.Just read the previous dozen or two posts and you'll see the same behavior pattern repeated.If you are thinking of using them as your bank .... DON'T. If you are using them, get your money out NOW!\n",
            " - Novo closed my account gave me part of my money DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY!!! They have no contact information I will be reporting them to the proper authorities\n",
            " - I am trying to get my money out of this bank and my card is declining for no reason. They don’t have a number call!\n",
            " - This bank behaves in a criminal fashion and I'm amazing it's still in business.  I will be doing whatever necessary to report it to the proper authorities to shut it down.  The issue is simple, you can easily deposit money but they make it impossible to pull money out.  They advertise free domestic wires.  Well, what they don't tell you, at least no place easily found on landing pages or main website page is that you cannot wire money out and they place a tiny cap on what can be transferred out.  You don't even have the option of writing a large check.  Insane and criminal.  I have asked to shut down my account, I'll see how long it takes to get my money back.  Horrible mistake signing up with this company.\n",
            " - I know that behind organisations like Novo there are many people with a genuine desire to do things well and stand out. Unfortunately, all those efforts to try to propose a modern, viable banking alternative for nascent organisations is completely lost in terrible customer service like very few others. This is totally unacceptable in an organisation on which a company's revenues and finances must rest. The integration they have with Plaid is flawed (this kind of technical glitch can happen) - what CANNOT happen is offering customers a response to their requests exclusively through a chat on the mobile app. Nor can it happen that there are no means of contact through the web version of the institution. Messages are responded to with utter disregard, many hours, or days later. I am truly disappointed that I took the time to open this account, and I am even more disappointed that I spent additional time trying to resolve the problems I had there, without any diligence from their side in resolving them. For anyone looking for a modern banking alternative, I highly recommend Wise. Unfortunately, it does not offer the possibility to carry out payouts quickly, but it is an organisation that works, and I have been able to verify this in different countries around the world where I operate.\n",
            " - I wouldn't recommend them. There's no easy way to deposit funds. I was overdrawn $20 and repeatedly asked them, (when I could reach them by email, as they have absolutely no means of speaking with anybody) if I could give them my other debit card to cover it, or mail a check to cover it. They did not. They closed my account, and I have commissions still going to that account because my company has hundreds of independent contractors, and don't know who the refunds belong too. Novo refused to give me any assistance with what they sent back to my company, so I may never see these funds because they can't tell me what was sent back.Absolutely no customer service. No way to add funds via an ATM. Terrible!!!\n",
            " - Very bad! I feel robbed! I opened the account based on the false reviews and now they have my money but when I try to use the card it is always declined! NO SYPPORT nobody answers phone or email and then you're out of a ton of money. I tried taking the money from ATMs but no luck either, this is ABSURD how can this be legal i the USA? I am sure they are breaking some laws! DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT run away\n",
            " - A frustrating experience. I chose this business banking option b/c it looked like the best fit for an online business with great app integrations. But there are too many issues with basic functions so who cares if there will be app integrations when i finally get to it:1) couldn't log in for an entire day2) micro deposits to link to external accounts (bank and paypal) isn't working. Should be same day but advised it could take upto 3 business days max. It's been 6 business days and nothing.3) reached out to Support and they advised the same message of it should be 3 days, if not check the account info was entered correctly with external bank. Both are correct and still no response.4) reached out via email but you cannot see the response via email or on the Novo app from your computer. You have to log in via your phone. Why? If you are a fintech company that specializes in digital communitcation, shouldn't this be effortless? And when you do try the 2-factor authentication doesn't work, at one time it is via phone number and another via email. You just keep entering the info again and again to receive the same copy and paste message. If like me, you tried to use an online banking solution to make it easier for you and avoid fees, this is a big time suck. Brick and mortar banks like Capital One and Chase have much better digital communication. Unfortunately it does look like i'll just have to suck it up and move to a brick and mortar bank and deal with mainitaining a min balance or fees\n",
            " - I really wanted to love Novo, but there are a few things that have ended up being deal-breakers for me. One is that you can't connect it to Zelle. Another is that the connection to Venmo constantly has issues, as other here have mentioned. (It will decline transactions even if you have plenty of money in your account.) But the most important flaw is that support takes forever to reply to you when you have an issue. I'm running a business here, and have already had one issue where a contractor needed payment and I couldn't process it because of a silly limit in Novo's interface. It took almost a week for them to respond to me, by which time I had to resort to some clever juggling which will be a pain in the neck at tax time. There are some great positives to Novo: integrations with Shopify and Stripe, for example. But for me they don't outweigh the negatives any longer.\n",
            " - There have been too many issues. I had difficulties paying people from this app even though the money was available. I was able to pay the first 2 people but by the 3rd and 4th person I was being declined with no explanation. I tried contacting support and that was a dead end. Absolutely no phone support and non-helpful email support is available. Yesterday I tried logging into the account via web and app for tax purposes. Both failed. Maybe the app was down but there was no communication from the company explaining what was going on. I already knew from my prior experience not to even bother trying to contact support. I am switching to a different company. My suggestion to anyone reading this review, do not use NOVO. Thank me later.\n",
            " - Instead of relying on a proper 2 Factor Authentication workflow based on a code generation app like Google Authenticator or Duo Security, they have a poorly implemented system based on SMS.So it takes about 10 minutes to login, because it sends a code to the phone, then kicks you out anyway from the website, then sends you a code via email, it pretends to log you in and then kicks you out again.You understand...painful.And this is a \"high technology bank\"!There is absolutely no need to \"confirm my business name\". The problem is the platform. Nothing wrong with my account.\n",
            " - I initially really loved Novo. In fact, I opened a second account with them for my second company. Unfortunately, my debit card expired and I still had not received my card. I contacted them and was assured my card would be sent. It never was. The next thing I see (a month after the card had expired) was a notice that a new card was sent to an address not even on my account. I immediately contacted them again. All they could offer was to send a new card \"express mail\" and that it would require a signature. But then said they could not give any tracking information so if I wasn't available for signature, it would get returned. They couldn't tell me the date it would ship or when it would arrive. Just that I needed to be there for signature if I was getting it shipped express. The only other option was \"standard delivery\" which they said could take up to 20 business days to be shipped. It is now 2 months since my card expired and I still do not have one. I've been told it's going to ship multiple times, but each time it does not and they tell me it was \"due to unforeseen circumstances\". I honestly am unsure if I'll ever get a debit card again at this point because they just don't ever ship it. I plan to close the accounts and switch to another bank.\n",
            " - Continual time out, something went wrong error messages when I try to log in.  Even a database is shutting down error message!Customer service is terible.I am closing this account as sonn as I am able\n",
            " - Very unsettling. I've had a few connectivity issues between my accounting software and Novo Bank, but now I am unable to link the account or even log into the site (mobile or web). Support access is limited to email. There was no notice sent regarding account login/functionality issues, but according to my software this has been at least a 12hr issue.I require access to my account at this time for tax prep and invoicing. I can't even see a balance. If this is the future...\n",
            " - I’ve only had terrible experiences with this  implant since I opened an account with them. Save your time and go to a company with actual customer service, or at least one whose software works well enough that you don’t need to go to customer service so often. They were no help when I had dozens of weird transactions on my card, I get a foreign transaction fee through PayPal with them often, and THEY REJECTED A PERFECTLY GOOD CHECK of mine after I had already endorsed it for deposit at NOVO—and would only tell me sorry, go get another check and try again when I told them their software made a mistake? I’ve deposited dozens of mobile checks with other banks before and never had an issue. I’m taking my checks and my money elsewhere.\n",
            " - Run away!  I thought the integrations with Novo were great, but like the other reviews, there is NO customer support.  I was trying to transfer money into my account in order to keep it current and was having problems, then my account was closed despite multiple emails to their support group that went unanswered.  Never answered.  I tried to call the support number which is only on the back of your debit card, and entered my account number, then was told to send an email to support.  I tried again to call and entered my debit card number, and same thing - they told me to send an email.  I am now worried they are sending my account to collections when I have been with them for years.   I will take them to court if they try to report my account for any reason.  I am so upset with this company.  I am surprised there is no class action against them.\n",
            " - I really want to like novo bank. They have a lot of feature that I can see being very useful. The only issue that is making it impossible for me to use them is that I can’t make debit purchases over $5k. Also they only allow one physical debit card per account, which also makes them impossible for me to use. I think I would still recommend if those caveats don’t hinder your business.\n",
            " - Calling Novo a business bank is like calling a Camry a Lamborghini - a flat out overstatement! Not only is Novo unprepared to provide any level of timely customer service (only making chat support available via their mobile app - not a single phone number available), but the platform takes 2x longer than any other bank I've done business with to process transactions. Furthermore, they falsely advertise their perks and don't stand by what they promise on sales calls. Every payment I try to make gets denied; they limit you to $5,000 in payments per day; they force you to use their mobile app as if business owners don't work from a desktop; and their check deposit tool is complete garbage - constantly asking for reuploads. Needless to say, we found a new bank and are terminating our relationship with Novo. This was a huge mistake that I hope other small businesses don't make. If you're a small business, cash-flow is crucial. Waiting 4-5 days for checks to clear and ACH transfers to deposit isn't a business banking solution - it doesn't even qualify as a personal banking solution. I'll be surprised if Novo doesn't go out of business.\n",
            " - Novo for business banking is terrible. I tried using my NOVO card for one purchase and it pulled money out of my NOVO account, as well as my external account at Wells Fargo? I tried resolving the situation since I was charged 60$ for a 30$ charge and NOVO customer service is awful. They “solved” my problem by refunding my external account and making my NOVO balance -30$? Never use this bank they are terrible\n",
            " - The banking is ok. But when starting a business and not being able to access money quickly and no real customer support. little to no phone support. You can't talk with a manager and the app support takes hours to get an answer.\n",
            " - Trying to set up a business account. I set my email and password and started the application, but was interrupted so had to continue later. The system locked me out - even though I confirmed my email, the system gae notifcation that the password or email was incorrect and attempting to reset password, no reset password link was sent.The sign up process is rather detailed and they ask a lot of information. Due to this simple problem of no being able to access my account set up, Novo is permanently eliminated from possible business bank options.\n",
            " - Initially my experience with Novo was good. I knew I wasn’t getting interest or phone based customer service. Writing checks and sending invoices via the app worked well. Problems arose when I had 3 credit cards stolen from me (including Novo card). They were used to make charges of a few thousand each. Two of the banks returned the money immediately. Novo said it would take up to 6 months. The process from there went downhill quickly. Despite having video evidence of the theft and a police report, Novo kept asking me for the same info over and over again. When I would ask questions about this through the app, I kept getting template responses. The only reason I got my money back after 6 months was my steady persistence. Had I not done this Novo would not have returned my money. This violates all the reasons to have a bank account: trust that the bank will treat customers fairly, protect my money, and provide excellent oversight and customer service. Novo failed me on all these categories. I had to keep Novo untilI got my money back. In the interim I found several better no-fee online banks - some that even pay up to 2% interest and have strong customer service that included a phone number. I would not recommend Novo to anyone due to the fact it cannot be trusted to protect you or your money.\n",
            " - Novo frankly does everything well. From the clarity of what was needed to open the account, to the ease of getting started, to the daily operational features that make running a business so much easier. The \"little\" things like the virtual credit card or bank letter showing account ownership that make all the difference when slicing bureaucratic red tape other places. Thank you for a great banking solution!\n",
            " - Well you can sure tell what reviews are fake and which reviews are real. I opened my novo account and had fraudulent charges right from the beginning.  I reported to them on 3 separate occasions that there were fraudulent charges. They didn't do a damn thing about it. I quit using the account and they began to harass me for money to cover the overdrawn account. I told them again that there was fraudulent charges. They closed the account and reported me to chexsystems and that has been a miserable experience in itself. So now because of their incompetence I suffer. Anyplace that uses chexsystems will not accept me as a customer. Customer service is the worst. Takes forever to get help or a general answer. There is way better options for banking.\n",
            " - No good for business,  don't supply check book,  can't speak with anyone personally on phone.  Replacement for any missing card takes 2 weeks to get sent out.\n",
            " - I've been banking with Novo for about a year now. I had my reservations because I hadn't heard of them. I did a little research and decided to give them a try.Getting my business account setup was simple. I only needed to submit the basic documents and the links were easy enough to access without any hiccups.Using my account has been seamless and it came with a plastic debit card and a virtual debit card. The one thing I learned the hard way was that the physical card came with daily attempt limits. Even if those attempts weren't successful, the attempts counted against my daily usage. It wasn't much of a big deal except that my business is all virtual. So, 24 hours without using my card is a huge hit. I learned to use my virtual card more than my physical card. Again, no big deal after learning, but lesson learned. All in all, Novo has been great! I'd recommend them to anyone needing to open an account online and not wanting the daunting task of going in to sit with a banker for an hour long sales pitch of other products.\n",
            " - I started off liking novo when I used previously however this time I have had such issues I closed my account. They kept refusing to deposit my checks from my employer without giving me reason. They would tell me to write deposit at novo only on the back in pen which I did then would tell me they wouldn’t deposit it but stated they didn’t have to give me a reason why they rejected it. So now my check was useless to another bank which upset my employer when I had to ask for another check. I will never use them again. Poor customer service.\n",
            " - The Business structure and App are very good so im happy keeping them as a banking source. My issues so far-Over 3 months to receive debt card, the connected bank/App function is seriously broken when it comes to access my funds waiting on card. Only option was a 5 day wait EBT. I'm sure that doesn't happen to everyone so I can't let my bad experience completely reflect on them.Good stuff-They offer paper checks to anyone you request. The sign up process is thorough and check cashing is easy being able to add dba's\n",
            " - Was with Novo for over three months and never received a physical debit card even though They told me that it was on the way the entire time.Had multiple online transactions not go through with my virtual debit card that caused me to use my personal account for the business purchases.Although these things don’t necessarily Inhibit a one star review however on top of this their customer service is not efficient at all and I am overall extremely disappointed with the service.Switched to Chase Business and have my debit card within 3 days of signing up.\n",
            " - Impossible to get ahold of customer service in a reasonable amount of time. “Reserves” are misleading. At other banks these are like cash envelopes or buckets. Apparently at novo they can show an amount of money that isn’t actually there. Very misleading and caused us to make poor financial decisions thinking we had significantly more money available in our account than we actually did.\n",
            " - This is the worse bank. You need to bank with a bank that protects your money. Stay clear of this bank.\n",
            " - This bank provides unreliable service and  unnecessary difficulties. 1) Received a fraud alert after business hours and no one was available to address the matter or remove the temporary lock on the account, 2) Bank does not provide check books, 3) During business hours, getting support is a hit or miss, phone rings and you're expected to leave a message or go through chat support online 4) Phone support never seems to have the answers and expect you to wait to receive a message through chat support that sometimes take days to resolve, 5) Sending check payments to vendors/customers takes at least 2 weeks to process and that does not include delivery time, 6) Chat support is a hit or miss, lack of available agents, 7) Strict limits on the amount of money you can transfer in a day or strict limits on the amount of purchases you can make in one day. Overall, not a good service for consultants or business owners. This service is better for people who just want a place to hold money.\n",
            " - Worst bank, DO NOT USE! PRETTY MUCH A SCAM! I made an account, then after sending money to it to verify the account, my access was denied. I haven't received any real assistance, just generated useless messages. I am unable to access my account, and my money. Worst bank experience of my life, I am shocked that this is scam is allowed to pose as a real business.\n",
            " - There's a lot to like about Novo. Slick app, some forward thinking features and decent customer services. I've been a customer for a few years, but considering leaving after this running balance issue outlined below.A huge glaring omission keeps it from being a true Business Checking account. No running balances. Anywhere. Not even on your monthly bank statement. I had a recent event happen where a CC Payment was rejected because even though Novo showed I had $xxxx.xx available, part of the balance was pending, but didn't show pending. Confirmed by phone support. Customer Service can see a running balance on their end, but Customers don't get one. Also, you can't add an External Bookkeeper / Accountant without fully adding them as a user to Submit an Application. No way to add just a web-based login for another user. You have to share your login credentials which then kicks you out of your own session.Lastly, MFA is via SMS and Email, no true MFA options with an Authenticator.\n",
            " - High level of security for account access.\n",
            " - The Novo support team has no authority or power to do anything. The one time the support team could have helped me, they instead deactivated my debit card without my consent which prevented me from making essential and time critical purchases. When I tried to make the purchases using the virtual card instead, I was not able to because of a $500 limit which is frustratingly not written anywhere in the app, website or any documentation. The support team - who go by very condescending names such as Jester and Princess - were not able to do anything about the limit. I also received the debit card to my home address instead of my business address so the website/app doesn't work well either.\n",
            " - I was curious about Novo and decided to try them out. I was declined an account and I asked numerous times why; the first rep did not have access to the info, and the second rep sent me a link to the generic application method and what they used to decide. Still not an answer, just a generic response; the escalation team got involved and did the same thing and couldn't give me a reason for my account not being approved. I have never dealt with a bank that withheld information about their decisions to approve you, whether it's a loan or mortgage, just an account being opened. Any bank that cannot disclose these details should not be able to access my personal information and withhold the details. Many larger banks larger offer the same integrations and good customer service, so keep on looking if you are still researching Novo.\n",
            " - Novo was able to get everything started very quickly, it has been nice to have it set up with our Stripe account. It is also very easy to pay my contractors via ACH and also increase permanently the amounts that we are allowed. That said, paper check would have been nice, at least for my industry. You can send checks via the app but that doesn't make for happy contractors. We ended up getting an account set up at a birck and mortar bank but we still use Novo for all of our online transactions. Not good enough for us to use only Novo but good enough for us to keep open and keep using. If you are an online only business or you process payments with something like stripe it will be a breeze but if you take or need an material money then it's very limited even with the ability to go into another bank.\n",
            " - I would recommend going with another bank. I used Novo for about a year and a half. Customer service is lacking and you will receive little support anyway. If you need support, you have to submit a ticket. It also means if you have anything urgent, you’ll be out of luck. The final straw for us was when our business had changed structure and Novo said it required a new account so just resubmit an application and then we’ll just transfer our funds over, easy enough. It was rejected and we received no assistance. They say “If you feel that you are receiving this message as the result of an error, please contact Customer Support.” But then customer support and they say they can’t tell you or help you and if you believe it was an error, then reapply. They were already doing business with us and had our money! We found out when applying with another bank, we needed a specific paper from the Secretary of State. The other bank had a phone number where you could talk to an agent who would actually assist you instead of giving the runaround. Since my account had tens of thousands all the time, I can only assume they care about the accounts with hundreds of thousands or millions, but at that point you really should have a “real” bank who will almost certainly give you no fees and real customer services at that level anyway. Then they email me to spread the word and give 5 stars? Novo doesn’t seem to care about the customers they have by providing little to no support, go find a real bank or credit union. You don’t want to be in a situation where your business is at a standstill while you wait for a bank who just refuses to help you.\n",
            " - I initially had a lot of trouble calling in their customer service line for assistance with getting a new debit card mailed to me because the first one got lost in the mail. Someone must have mentioned it to higher-ups because I was pleasantly surprised to find out that option is available via Novo app and it was easy to request for a new card. Thank you! Novo keeps costs down for my new start-up. No hidden fees or charge for using their business checking account or savings and you can easily put aside a percentage of revenue to reserve for taxes, marketing, etc.\n",
            " - I would honestly give them zero stars if I could. This so called “bank” is THE WORST. I’m starting a new business and have $125k in my account with them. I have waited over a month for the physical debit card (they keep postponing when it should arrive) and tell me to use my virtual card. Well despite more than twenty attempts asking them to increase my $500 virtual card daily limit, they refuse. Despite have six figures in my account. This has halted my business operations and cost me, time,Money and immense frustration on top of getting my business to open to the public (we’re a zoo/adventure park) a month from now. Customer service is AWFUL and just repeats the same generic messages. RUN!\n",
            " - UNREAL.  12/2 called the number on the bank of my card to make them aware of pending fraudulent transactions.  The rep gave me a Case# and told me to call back in 10-15 days if I didn't have a letter from the bank.  12/30 called again because I received nothing, was bounced through 6 people and received an additional Case Number (the original was worthless) and finally landed on Janice.  Janice told me that I needed to submit the dispute through the website AND that I needed to either provide proof that *I* had contacted the vendor to request a refund OR provide them with a letter indicating that I wanted them to take 120 days to refund my money.  During the course of the conversation I advised Janice that I didn't have to do this with any other my other banking partners to which she replied: \"Sir, we aren't a bank, we're a Fintech company\".  Novo ... bank ... isn't a bank.  It's a FINTECH company masquerading as a bank.  I'm executing transfer of my money immediately.  This \"Bank\" is TRULY FUBAR.\n",
            " - Awful. Opened a small business account and they emailed me at 9AM that I needed to respond by 11AM or they would return a check I wrote because it has a duplicate check number from before.  Apparently they expect their customers to be at their beck and call all hours of the day, but good luck getting a hold of someone.  You leave a message on some voicemail and it disappears into the ether. No access to Venmo, Zelle or Paypal.  I withdrew money with my Novo card from a Chase ATM and the machine didn't dispense money, it took 9 days for them to even acknowledge my claim, then they told me I had to go to Chase (not true), then they finally accepted my claim and told me it would take 4 months to resolve. 4 months !!!! Entire countries can go bankrupt in that amount of time. The only reason my account is still open is because we are in month 3 of 4 and as soon as I get that cash back... byebye Novo, I'm going to a reputable bank instead.\n",
            " - Stay away from this company. They have the worst customer service that I have ever experienced in my life. You can’t get in touch with them. If you leave a message they don’t call you back. If you do happen to get in touch with them and tell them about your problem, it’s still doesn’t get taken care of most of the time you can’t even contact them on the phone. Nobody ever answers.\n",
            " - Summary: It seems to me Novo has spent a lot of time developing, albeit useful, features, now they need to go back and spend some time on getting the basics done right so it's not a frustrating user experience.Setting up an account was easy. Using the account is pretty easy. They have a lot of good features. The customer support is pretty decent. However, there are many many annoyances that aren't addressed.For example, I can't use the web app to contact customer service. It means I have to do all interaction with them on the phone, which is extremely tedious and inefficient. It's been a long time and they keep promising this for the web, and it's not forthcoming. Every time I log in now, since a few months back, I'm prompted that it's a new machine, then I need to get a confirmation code via SMS. But that's not enough, they send me an email too, which takes minutes to arrive. Every time I login I go through that crap, and it makes using the webapp a frustrating experience. CS should triage this at this point instead of reassuring me. Have someone actually help me because it's clearly an issue. I'm a software developer and I know what I\"m doing. It's not me.Telling customer service about this problem they just tell me it will sort itself out. Then I wait, and the ticket gets closed, and I Have to open a new one. It should be easy to re-open another ticket, but it's not. You have to create a new one each time, so you end up with a ton of tickets. It's not easy to see if a check has been cashed or not. the language is confusing, and they don't provide an image of the check with a signature that I've seen other banks do.It also took a long time for me to send a check, and I was under the impression it would be sent out sooner, so the communication there could be tightened. Having to submit my ID again after being a customer awhile, otherwise risking account closure or whatever was really weird to me. On the road and being busy traveling, I don't have time to submit my ID on a regular basis. That's silly. Customer services are outsourced to other countries. If you care about this, then it's probably not for you. I don't care about it as long as the people are competent and have the right amount of empowerment. The correspondence itself with CS on the app is confusing. You just have a list of messages, and there's no subject to give any indication what the ticket was about. If you want to find a ticket, good luck. For example, I have a number of tickets that just say \"Thanks for reaching out, we see you have a chat open about the issue, so we'll let that person handle it\". Why bother without even mentioning what the issue is linked to?I had a payment fail due to \"network issues\". This shows up as a transaction on mint.com and I didn't get an email saying it failed.  There was no re-attempt and I wasn't notified and thus was late on my monthly payment=========== REMEDIES ==========This is what you should do:1. Tickets should have a clear subject, right now each just says Me, and possibly a list of names. This is not useful.2. Get the web fixed for handling tickets.3. Fix the login issues on the web4. Don't ask me to send ID on a regular basis or risk disrupting my service5. Be clear when checks are sent, have been cashed etc.6. Notify customer on declined payments due to network issues or re-attempt\n",
            " - NOVO IS TERRIBLE. Stay far far away. Terrible customer service (mostly bots and automated responses). They hold your check deposits way longer than federal finance laws allow. I'm currently dealing with them holding a very large check deposited from my own personal IRA savings to Novo, and they claimed they needed to hold the check for 2 months due to \"security concerns.\" They reduced that to 1 month as a \"courtesy.\" I have proof that they received the funds two business days after I deposited the check, and despite uploaded documentation, they continue to give me bogus reasons why they must hold the funds to \"protect my account.\" In the meantime I lost a home and home office I wanted to purchase due to Novo's check hold. They are a fintech advertising banking services when in fact they are not a bank. Their mobile deposit agreement says they do not follow Regulation CC regarding check holds. OCC is currently adding more regulations for fintechs, and this can't come soon enough.\n",
            " - In August '22, I noticed several large suspicious charges hitting my virtual card within a short succession.  Thankfully, I was on my phone and able to lock the card before more money was stolen.  The charges originated from a merchant called \"True NT90s Bar Restaur\" located in Accra, Ghana (my business is local in Utah, USA...).  I disputed the charges with Novo and after over 4 months of no updates, they email me saying that the dispute has been rejected due to \"3d secure code\" (WTH does that mean??).  I am still missing over $1800 that was stolen and I will continue to fight to get this money back.  Needless to say, I will be taking my business elsewhere and would advise all others to do the same.\n",
            " - So simple to create and account and use every day!  I love the text notifications of money in or out!\n",
            " - Horrible horrible bank! Zero customer service! Refused to deposit a check because they said it looked suspicious! We are changing banks immediately! Do NOT open an account with this fake bank!\n",
            " - I’ve been waiting 3 months for a dispute investigation at time of writing this review. Terrible customer service, no follow up or updates. Just sitting back and waiting if $1900 that was stolen gets returned. Not worth saving $10 a month at a typical bank.\n",
            " - Absolutely the worst bank I have had each deposit take over a week to report and even show up as processing… so I deposit Friday and won’t get funds till maybe following Friday even for small deposit of around 1k\n",
            " - Something BAD is going on at Novo. I got a debit card that has stayed with me since I got it, and was only ever been used for recurring Google Domains purchases. One random evening, 7 fraudulent charges were made with that card back-to-back. After my fraud experience I googled \"novo debit card fraud\" only to find a review here who had the exact same experience- in their case, the card had never been used at all. The only thing I can surmise from this is that Novo is leaking debit card information from within, or have been hacked and don't know it yet.\n",
            " - I opened a Novo account after reading some grat reviews and the awesome integrations they offered into the sales plaforms I use. Unfortunately, security and the customer support needed after an incident were alarming. Yesterday I received a robocall that informed me that there was a potentially fraudulent charge on my Middlesex Savings Bank account. I didn't know what that was, so when I googled and found out it was the owner of Novo, I was confused - I have two factor turned on, haven't usd my account in months, and don't share the account with anyone. I called the number back, input the requested info, and was greeted by an Indian call center, which I immediately took as a scam and hung up. Upon loking into my account, I saw a $15 pending charge - no info was listed on where the charge was attempting to be processed, or any other info, just the amount and that it was pending. So I continue to look for a way to contact their support team on their website while logged in. NO phone number listed, NO live chat feature, just a robot, and NO way to contact support outside of their app. So I had to download their app, send an email letting them know I needed my account closd permanently. There is no way I would every trust my money, or my business in the hands of a company with absolutely ZERO customer service, especially in a time of fraud - ask for customer service and the best you will get is a call from an Indian call center, which they should probably know is going to be widely viewed as a scam due to the amount of scamming that goes on in Indian call centers. Literally every stage of my journey with Novo outside of initial setup has been a nightmare - a warning - DONT DO IT\n",
            " - Novo Bank is a fraud. They are taking advantage of small businesses. Fraudulent charges were made to my account. I contacted Novo after spending several hours on the phone and several unhelpful emails. That basically blames me for the charges. I was told I had to wait 120 days for the fraud department to file a claim with the merchant. After 120 days, I reached out to Novo to be given the runaround, calling every day for the dispute department to tell me that there is nothing they can do and that I would have to contact the police department if I would like to pursue or file a report. At this point, it has already been 150 days. While disputing the original claim I also receive another fraudulent charge to my account. so that is a total of two charges that total almost $500. DO NOT TRUST NOVO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION NOR YOUR CLIENTS.\n",
            " - I could not be more frustrated. Four months ago someone stole my wallet. I called all the credit cards to cancel the charges and possible charges. I only had an issue with Novo. They ignore my complaint, they did not cancel the card in time, and after MONTHS trying to reach someone at customer care (if they can say that is customer care) they asked me to pay a $400 charge made at Walmart that the criminal made. When told that I was trying to reach out to someone without a solution for 4 months, they just told me to talk to Walmart and see if they give the money back.Basically, if you need help, leave this bank alone.\n",
            " - Literally just want to speak to a live person so they verify me, help me log in and close this account. Their email responses have been very lacking with one even telling me 'your response is available on the mobile app'... which I also can't log in to.Absolutely ridiculous that they have NO PHONE NUMBER to contact.\n",
            " - There is something very screwy with this company. It is supposed to be a legitimate business bank but they are a bit shady.I opened an account with them for a holding company to transfer real estate income from my properties. I was issued a debit card which I never used. It never left the box in my desk drawer. I made online transfers only. Somehow, a charge was made on this debit card. This should not be possible unless someone inside the company gave my information out. I don't see how someone could have guessed my card number, AND my business name? But it somehow happened.When I disputed the transaction, it took Novo 5 months only to refuse the dispute. I have never had such an awful experience with a bank. I will never use an online-only bank again.\n",
            " - Novo bank has been my worst experience with banks. Most of the times I’ll transfer earnings from PayPal to my account and Novo will show its posted but it wouldn’t reflect on my balance amount for a day or two. This is not the first time this happened it’s a frequent issue with Novo. My advice to anyone who has their account find a different bank.\n",
            " - They can make you be  a bad situation for business banking.First of all opened the account ,it was a bit of a process but understand because of all the fraud going on!

            " - We've used Novo for an LLC business account for about a year now.  It's a very simple set-up.  We invoice a single client, once a month, for deposit into the Novo account. Then we distribute funds as personal draws. It's a grand-total of about 5 transactions per month.As a \"Fintech\" company the movile first model is OK, but it *should* work, but there are so many problems, the code is alpha at best. support is non-existent.  I mean really non-existent.  I have an open support ticket for a broken transaction with no idea of the state of a $3K transfer, and after 24 hours, no one has even acknowledged it.The error message is unspecific, and appears in a way that you can't capture it, and does not tell you if the transaction completed or failed. Support has still never responded.\n",
            " - I was informed about Novo after searching for ways to streamline my business (banking wise), and eliminating trips back and forth to my existing brick and mortar bank. I watched and read plenty of reviews, did my due diligence and settled on Novo over the competition. I was excited by the description of a completely online banking experience where I could deposit checks electronically, have separate \"reserves\" and integrate Novo with my QuickBooks and Zapier subscptipns. The setup was fairly easy and I was approved for an account within a week. I was then informed that I needed to fund the account and navigated to the \"Move Money\" screen so I could mobile deposit my most recent invoice check. That is where I discovered that new accounts have deposit and check mailing limits in the amounts of $20k for mobile deposits per check and per day with a maximum of $40k deposited per month, and a check mailing limit of $5k per check and per day with a maximum of $50k in mailed checks per month. The check I wanted to deposit was over $60k. I submitted a support request to have my limit increased but was denied and told that I could get a temporary limit, but that limit would then expire every month and I would have to continue to resubmit. Unfortunately this limit makes Novo useless to me and my business. I was hopeful that Novo would make my life easier but with the limits imposed, the app would require as much time (and cause as many headaches) as my traditional bank. Ultimately I ended up cancelling my account and will explore other avenues.\n",
            " - This is not at all what I signed up for! I can't pay most of my business bills, the \"support\" articles are largely unhelpful, and the whole experience has been disappointing. There is no in-person chat feature for questions. I've de-funded my account and just want to close it and move on, but that's also proving to be a challenge. I really hope they up their support game, and soon. Total headache; I will not be recommending!\n",
            " - I had no issues with the bank until my cards were stolen out of my wallet in a locked locker at the gym.  A total of 5 debit/credit cards were stolen and transactions made of $200 at the nearest walmart. Of course a police report was filed immediately and all banks/credit cards were notified with a dispute. All funds were returned except NOVO Bank which was swiped 5 times totaling $1000.  Multiple calls were made to several Novo customer service reps after not receiving a letter from the bank as stated in the app.  None of the reps were any help except for the last lady, \"Chanelle\" on 9/20/22 who couldn't even find the dispute on file.  She thankfully wrote a dispute ticket in efforts to help me.  On 10/12/22 Novo, after whatever review stated they would not return the funds because of \"WM SUPERCENTER\".  I have no clue what that means but I told every customer service rep that I can supply the police report if need.  Clearly it I was robbed yet, the bank failed to protect my funds or offer a solution.\n",
            " - this bank is terrible they held my funds for 4 weeks... Im running a business no one has time for that, they also declined credit card payments so now all my payments are late.. the customer service is trash they take days to get back to you, phone support is useless the only thing there good for is to open a ticket that you can already do... they promise to fix the problem fast thats a lie... there site says \"human-powered customer service\" well its terrible.. fyi they froze my account over an error that accrued on their end when i tried to log in and it took them 4 weeks lol absolutely insane....  DO NOT RECOMMEND NOVO BANKING!!!!!\n",
            " - Debit cards are declined on a regular basis.  When I'm attempting to purchase items for my business, the debit cards are declined. No support available since I'm on the west coast. Moving to a different bank.\n",
            " - I had a recent issue where funds were transferred out of my account without notice, without authorization, and without any details to indicate why the funds were withdrawn and by whom. It took several rounds with tech support to get any information.  Eventually it was shared that another service had requested the withdrawal, again, with no notice to us and without the ability to contest it or request additional information. Novo needs to do a better job of alerting account holders - in advance -  when they are going to withdraw funds when the transaction has not been authorized by the account holder. They also need a process to allow the account holder to contest a disputed withdrawal before it happens.Finally, it is only possible to contact support via the app and not the website. This greatly negatively impacts our ability to share information and resolve issues.Finally, the support team was not as responsive as I would expect and I had to follow-up with them several times to get the answers I needed.\n",
            " - I've had an account for two months. The overall experience has been good. I've deposited seed money from a personal check via the app, set up recurring payments via the electronic debit card, used the physical debit card, added my state's Doing Business As name onto the account, had a couple of questions answered by the Support team. All of the above worked as advertised. I like that I don't need to maintain a minimum balance like some of the big banks require. I also like that the customer experience seems targeted to startup businesses. Someday I will probably use one of the integrations (maybe Stripe). The only unexpected things have been: the app dollar amounts update at different times on different pages, so one page can say that a check has been deposited, but another page disagrees; and the web site doesn't have a way to communicate with Support, so you have to use the app for that.\n",
            " - Worst bank ever.  What would be a 5 minute phone call at any other bank, is days or emailing back and forth and this bank.  You can only contact them via email, which they will take their sweet time getting back you from. The customer service number they do have will only connect you with someone who will inform you “their policy and procedures prevent supervisors and account specialist from making and receiving phone calls” Which means anyone who can help you, can’t make or receive phone calls. Their “security” measure make you jump through hoops just to get access to your own account and pay your employees.  I don’t know of any other bank that does this.  Do not use unless you enjoy not having access to your money.\n",
            " - This bank is a disaster. No one knows what they are doing. Bank manager Rafael Ponte was rude. 3 days of our vacation were wasted and they refused to release our funds. No where else in the world would it be acceptable for a bank to hold your funds in this manner. We left and set up a new account at a different bank. Do not recommend!!\n",
            " - The customer service is unprofessional.  I am not even sure that this is a ligitimate bank.  My debit card is expired and I have not received a new card.  I started to request a new card a month before it expired, and now 5 weeks later,  continue to contact them on a daily basis and the representatives usually arent available to speak on the phone, so I have to message through the app and they continue to say that they will mail a new card, but it has yet to come.  I am running a business and need a valid card linked up to my suppliers for purchases.  They do have a virtual card but I cannot use that when I go to vendors physical buildings to buy supplies nor can I use it at the ATM .  I have also requested a manager call back and been promised by five different representatives, who also promised me that they were Express mailing my card, and I have yet to receive a call or a new card .  Would not recommend this bank.  It's been a terrible experience for me.\n",
            " - It’s a great account! I enjoy everything it comes with. I don’t enjoy how slow everything is. The app does not update and for example let’s say you use your debit card for something, it won’t update till later or  me next day. They have a call center that is pretty slow and only works 9-5. But we are small businesses and if it takes a day to get a response it could be costly. If I get a direct deposit, I have to wait 3 days extra. That is stressful! If a customer pays out an invoice I have to wait 3-5 days. It’s just stressful sometimes using this account.\n",
            " - Personally, I like this bank, but they closed my account and now I haven't been able to reopen it.\n",
            " - My experiences have exceeded my expectations. I was worried about signing on with this bank. I hadn’t heard anything at all from anyone. But I didn’t have the ability to get out to open an account. My time is too constrained and I kept forgetting my documents to go to the bank with. It was a hassle. This was easy to set up, I didn’t have to go anywhere, and although I have to wait a few days for my checks to clear, I have not had a single issue. Painless!!\n",
            " - Ease of use, ease of access. Just what I needed and a debit card, too!\n",
            " - Novo is great for small businesses. The online/mobile accessibility and convenience is great. However NOVO requires a certain amount of days before funds are available after a deposit, also NOVO is not ideal for transfers since they don’t have Zelle. Lastly, when transferring money to another account there are a certain amount of days before the other party receives funds.\n",
            " - The service is not ready for prime time. The check deposit is slow and unreliable. The bank would refuse to deposit official checks without explaining why. You have to mark the check with \"for mobile deposit at Novo\", which makes it a pain to deposit to other banks after they refuse to accept it. The customer service is online only very slow to respond and not helpful in resolving issues. It is hard to run a business with such service. The idea is good, the execution is poor.\n",
            " - I had a brand new card with two transactions with trusted vendors before my card was compromised wiping half of the funds in my new business. I could not verify the authenticity of their own fraud department as they were asking for my account number after I had been told they would never request that information. Yet their email support confirmed the call was from their fraud department. Recently, Novo sent out several sms and email blasts about protecting your accounts from phishing attempts. How about Novo secures their information and protects consumers instead of placing the blame on us? The website and app work fine. But it’s clear this company is not equipped to protect your information from being misused, or to correct the issue securely through support. I recommend larger and more established online business banking.\n",
            " - Everything with this bank is great, except that they don’t and won’t give you check books. They only allow you to send checks through them in the mail which takes incredibly long\n",
            " - JUST DONT.  Protect your business and go elsewhere.  They have zero customer service, reporting fraud incidents is incredibly difficult, and they are NOT here to help or serve you as a business owner, they’re here to profit only. It was so bad with a fraud issue once I contacted Middlesex bank which they work under - Middlesex gets so many calls from people like me that the supervisor I ended up speaking with said his recommendation is that I leave Novo and take my business elsewhere - BECAUSE he gets many calls like mine a day, and he’s unable to help anyone who calls in.  Again, Novo has no customer service. JUST DONT.\n",
            " - Doing ok. Better than most banks that claim small business support.  Yet they don't authenticate using true 2FA, with QR code shared secret authentication, but rather a three pronged SMS and email authentication system which requires me to pull POP emails down manually from my business email address while also pulling from my text messages in a painful and hard-to-execute process all for a 30 second balance check on a website, declaring instead that I should just use the mobile app on a 3.5\" screen instead of the three 25\" screens that are truly more suited.And yes, this is after I just checked the box \"Remember me for 30 days\" while logging in.\n",
            " - I was so impressed with how quickly Novo resolved and refunded a fraudulent charge. They sent a new card immediately and I felt like they took great care of me and my account. I recommend Novo to every freelancer/small biz owner I know.\n",
            " - No way to reach anyone by phone. Takes notoriously long for funds to clear. How can you keep funds away from business owners where working capital is essential in their success.\n",
            " - Horrible Bank. Not sure why I opened my Account with these folks. There is NO OPTION to download QuickBooks QBO files for QuickBooks Desktop version.There is no Proper Customer Service, everything has to be EMAIL. No Live Chat, No Live Phone Calls.I will slowly move my account to a main stream bank soon.\n",
            " - Terrible costumer service. Extremely low response time, no number to contact them directly. They treat your business account like a personal checking. Very frustrating\n",
            " - I have three accounts and they cannot link them.  I need a new email address for every account.  They don't allow me to give it a nickname so that I know which account I am in.  You have to search for the logoff link - its hidden in \"Settings\".  They make me verify its me every 30 months. And while it was just a text, its now a code from a text AND the email account.  Sending checks for billing takes 7-10 days to reach the biller.  I have repeatedly given them feedback - they ask for it - and they never do anything to help make it easier.  Its not the right bank for me.  Too many negatives.\n",
            " - I’ve had two check deposits rejected for no apparent reason, and their customer service can’t even tell me why. It’s as if it’s run by bots instead of real people. If you must deal with physical transactions—checks and the like—I can’t imagine a worse option than Novo. Why they offer check deposits is bewildering under the circumstances. This \"bank\" proves that you get what you pay for. Free is not worth the price for their being utterly useless.\n",
            " - My Novo account was hacked. It’s been 4 months and although they claim to be FDIC insured none of the thousands of dollars in fraudulent charges have been returned to my account. Representatives refuse to call me. When I finally got a phone number I sat on hold for 30 minutes then a message came on that said no representatives are currently available and instruct me to leave my info then they send a message through the app and I get no help. I’m getting the same excuse that the charges are being investigated. I’m taking legal action but my advice is run away if you haven’t opened an account yet, and if you have a Novo account reconsider choosing a bank where your hard earned money is secure. My experience with them has been a nightmare.\n",
            " - Overall our experience has been pretty good using Novo.  The only drawback we have run into is that there is no one to call when an issue or question arises.  They do have a way to send a message to support, but that is accessible only through the phone app and not through the web login.  Having said that, the response time to the support requests made through the app is typically the same day, and usually within an hour or two.  They also send you an email saying a response has been sent to the app.\n",
            " - NOVO has been working great as my main business bank account. I especially love the fact that I can use Zapier to send transactions to my Google spreadsheet. I didn't see any other bank that could do that.Transfers show up in my other bank accounts when expected. Options for instant transfers exist for a small fee but two days is plenty fast enough for me.In my other bank institutions it clearly shows my business name as where the money came from which is great since I used to use a personal account before and I couldn't use a business name.\n",
            " - Novo is the worst \"bank\" experience I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Their customer service is absolutely abysmal. I've had my novo account for several months and it seemed to work well but then suddenly all of my debit cards quit working and several recurring transactions setup failed. There's plenty of money in the account but transactions are failing due to \"Security\". Please inform me how my recurring monthly payment to Shopify was flagged for \"security\". It's not as if Shopify is some shady fly by night internet scam they're a huge company. Talking to \"Customer Service\" which in the case of novo should be called \"Customer Pass Around\" was AWFUL. You can't initiate customer service through their website you have to chat through their mobile app. The only phone number they have is on the back of the debit card and good luck calling that. You'll listen to an annoying techno beat for hours and finally give up. I seriously think they just have a number that plays music. I've never successfully had anyone pickup the phone. NOVO bank is awful and I am closing my account today.\n",
            " - If I could give this \"bank\" zero stars I would. This bank was ok in the beginning then out of nowhere my account started to randomly become negative.  It was confusing as1. I had no transactions during that timeI waited a day before fixing the negative as I thought the system made an error and would fix it automatically. The next day I log in1. My account was even MORE negative2. No transactions So I transferred money from my reserves into my checking.  I then looked all over for a phone number for this \"bank\" couldn't find one and then I thought to look on the back of the card found numberThey had no reason for my account to be negative. They said it never was.  But I never received the money back from the transfer.  Since this incident1. I had an negative account for no reason about 5 more times2. Just like last time I trans money from my reserves 3. I asked for a running ledger on my amount.  They said they can't do that.4. I found a way to download all my transactions and no where in the transactions does it show internal transactions 5. My reserves account shows the money was transferred outThe help center is no help at all.\n",
            " - October 4, 2022On Wednesday, September 28th I initiated a $200 ACH transaction from my Chase Account to Novo Account. On Thursday, I checked my account to verify if the funds were posted. Later in the day I tried to make a small Amazon purchase for business supplies. I also tried to add my Novo debit card to Instacart and the $0.10 authorization was declined for both my physical card as well as my virtual card.I immediately reached out to support for help. I have been contacting support since the 29th trying to find out why my account withdrawals have been frozen. I did not receive any communication from Novo that I would not have access to my funds.On yesterday I submitted another support request asking that a supervisor or manager contact me. This request has also gone unanswered. I tried to initiate a transfer twice today and I still do not have access to my funds. The responses that I have received from Tia and Angela M have not addressed the issue. I told Angela on Friday that we were going into the weekend, and I needed the matter resolved. Today is October 4th and I’ve yet to hear back from. It is apparent that Novo does not care about its customers. And their customer service is less than lack luster because you can never physically speak to anyone. Novo’s support is non-existent when you need assistance.I also had two fraudulent charges made by 7ARTS LTD. SOFIA BG in June totaling $4.00. I immediately disputed both charges in June of 2022. It is now October, and I still have not gotten this issue resolved.  Novo states that it takes up to 120 for answer. This is beyond ridiculous. It should not take a bank or any financial institution  4 months to reverse. Although the sum of money is small it is still mine.Novo is toying with my finances and that is not acceptable. I am formally filing a complaint with the BBB to assist in helping to getting these matters resolved.\n",
            " - Posting as a warning to those considering banking with Bank Novo. I had a bank account for a very short time with Bank Novo. It was awful. I have my final statement with them showing that I had a zero balance when I closed the account and emails confirming that I was closing my account. A $497 refund was accidentally sent to them by a costume vendor. After weeks of trying to get Novo to send proof of a rejection of the refund or issue me a check, they emailed me saying I had an extended overdraft and that the refund was taken to settle that. They will not provide any proof of this extended overdraft and I was never notified about it. They don't have a phone number to call and take days to respond to email.\n",
            " - Wow. This bank is rampant with fraud. Someone used my information (stolen from the banks weak security, not due to a lost card) to withdraw funds in Singapore and Ireland... I live in the United States in NY. The banks response was that no fraud occurred so they could not reimburse me.... The withdrawls were made from shady crypto services. Clearly fraud. But, they told me it was my fault. Which I guess it was... for using a terrible bank that has 0 security, allows people to steal your money and then does nothing to make it right. DO NOT USE NOVO if you do not want lose your $$$ to fraud.\n",
            " - I was a victim of fraud at this bank. Somebody activated my virtual card and had 4 attempt to wipe out my bank account: 3 declined transaction but the 4th got thru. Immediately I send them a message thru the mobile app but their time reaction was very slow, after few hours they give me a response to my inquiry, telling me that bad things happens and I need to dispute the transaction. It was their fault that my money was stolen because they didn't do the right thing on time. Now I need to wait for 120 days to have a result on my dispute ( I bet they will tell me that money can't be recover). They don't protect you from fraud and their customer service is useless. I don't have any documentation to show that I made a dispute only some messages where  they give me their sympathy. I don't need their sympathy, I need them to protect my money. Don't use this bank for your business, you are not protected and is a nightmare to resolve a problem.\n",
            " - I've used Novo for about two years now.Their promise is Business Banking That Saves You Time & Money. I cannot speak for everyone, but in my case, they have cost me a great deal of both time & money. And they don't seem to care. I have multiple businesses with multiple bank accounts and we use Novo for all of them (until I close all our accounts later this week). Although I'm clearly extremely annoyed at the time of writing this review, I aim to make this useful & honest. So here's the good and the bad. The good... Getting started with Novo is relatively easy & fast. They integrate with many of the most common apps that most small businesses are using (Stripe, Slack, etc). They also have a reserves feature that lets you basically allocate funds to have set aside (if you use Profit First this is convenient). Their support team is friendly and sometimes tries to help.In the beginning, this was a great experience. However, my trust in Novo and its operations has slowly deteriorated. The bad. Although they offer a small variety of essential integrations, they have an issue with re-connection. Sometimes this can cause serious problems. I'd love to share with them what some of these problems are so they could improve their operations like a normal business. But they don't seem to care. So here's what you can expect...1. Don't expect it to be easy to fund your account. Sometimes it'll be seamless. Other times it'll disconnect and refuse to reconnect. Getting any meaningful support for something like this is non-existent with Novo. After many attempts of running through the process, you're pretty much left with reporting a bug. And if what you're trying to do is urgent, you're out of luck. My hunch is that they're outsourcing this tech and actually have very little control over it/understanding of it. On top of this, you have a maximum deposit amount of like $1,500 (or someone where that ballpark). Like what on earth are we supposed to do with that?2. They logging on and off is ridiculous. Especially if you use them for more than one business. You're required to retrieve a code (often from both email & phone) within 30 seconds. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that they make security a priority. But there has to be a better way. Often, it's pretty difficult and stressful to get all this information from those locations that quickly. Sometimes I won't get it in the first 1-2 attempts and by that time I've wasted enough of my day trying to log into a bank account...Here's how I'd evaluate the fit for Novo...- You're a small business owner that often interacts with your own banking (transfers, cash infusions, etc)... DO NOT CONSIDER THIS BANK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE- You're a business owner that very rarely needs to do any of the things above. This is a great bank for you. Our finance team and investors literally thanked me when I brought up switching from Novo. This is honestly a heartbreaking review for me to write, I should be a brand ambassador for Novo and a constant source of referrals (cause all the potential is there). But they can't get it together and have created an adversary in the process.Edit: After interacting with their team more, I decided to update this to a one star review. Because the customer support with this ordeal has been not very competent. Obviously, for a bank that deals in small business... none of them have ever actually owned a business and it's extremely clear.\n",
            " - Sub-par at best. I’m not sure how Novo has such high reviews on NerdWallet and etc. As other reviewers have stated, depositing checks is a painfully slow process. Running a business requires cash flow, and I had checks take up to 9 days to appear in my account, which is simply unacceptable. Most notably, as my business has grown, Novo had only hindered us. I was expecting a large check (48k), and to avoid any issues with it, I contacted customer service to make sure everything was in order. I was told to apply to increase my check deposit limit (which was at 20k), and was approved. When I deposited the check, it was rejected. Twice, without explanation. Customer service’s advice? “Speak to the check issuer to make sure their checks meet federal formatting standards” or “take a credit card payment” or “request an ACH transfer.” I opened an account with Chase the next day and they deposited the check with zero issues. Customer service has been AWFUL throughout my experience, mostly because your only option is to chat with someone in the app. If you try calling the phone number on the back of your bank card, you’ll get an answering machine. It’s beyond frustrating to be unable to speak with a human being when you’re dealing with an issue as pressing as this was for me. All this said, if your business is super duper small and you don’t need much support, speed, or cash flow, Novo may work for you. As others have stated, if you intend to scale your business, don’t bother with Novo. Go straight to a traditional bank.\n",
            " - I've had my business account with Novo for about a year with no problems at all until recently. Once I made the bank aware of the problem on their end, the customer service was spot on with getting in touch with me & helping with the issue. The problem was fixed within a couple of days and all fees incurred were refunded. The process was handled professionally, politely, & relatively quick compared to the nightmare it might have been with a huge traditional bank entity.  I would recommend Novo to other small business owners.\n",
            " - Novo bank isnt as great as people are led to believe. The experience we had with them is mediocre at best.first one of our accounts get overdrawn 3600 dollars and they blame our company. what bank gives 3600 dollars to a customer when the funds are not available?next another account we had, for some reason gets frozen and no progress is made. when asked to close the account out an explanation that it is being investigated is given. nothing more. very frustrating\n",
            " - Based on my experience only and this is still going on after 2 months. Business Checking Account Customer Service-   1. No Phone Support even for fraud issues, outside the call concerning the fraud transaction as they were happening.   2. It takes at least 24 hours to get a canned message  3. No live chat support   4. Only contact method is on mobile, you can not message via desktop login Fraud-  1. I had fraud transaction on my debit card and Novo contacted me asking about the transactions. We deputed all over the phone. I thought it was done. 2. They wont replace my business debit card after 3 request and 2 months. Hard to do businesses with a virtual debit card only. They wont give a reason why. 3. 3 days after the fraud I tried calling Novo, I had to call back and ask about the money being returned to my account. No phone support, we had to handle this via email. At that time I was instructed to call the companies that had the fraud transactions and ask for a refund or negotiate a refund and supply the proof to Novo. I refused to call because I was the victim of fraud and asked them how is it even possible for me to call a company in Europe when I can't call international or have there phone number. 4. I was told they have 120 day to review the dispute, it took them 65 days to return 1 transaction and they denied 1 other, I still have 1 more in dispute. 5. I have asked Novo for proof I completed the transaction and why I shouldn't be refunded, currently unanswered at the moment. 6. I had to login and submit blank pages with my dispute because I didn't have proof of negotiating with the fraud vendors. Overall this has been my worst bank experience to date. I fully plan on closing my account when the deputes are completed. I have written proof of everything above and would be will to show proof so this review stays up. This bank has hurt my business and continues to hurt my business just by not reissuing a debit card and holding hundreds of dollars of my money waiting on them to review the case.\n",
            " - This Fintech/bank is a joke.  Took 10 days to deposit checks that cleared the day after deposit.  One check they said was altered which was completely false.  As soon as checks cleared they send email that they are closing the account and sending a check and they won't provide a business checking account.  No way to get the $2000 out the shut down ACH to another bank.  Despite having a company that has all the legal documentation and been around for 20 years.  The support is non-existent and you cannot speak to anyone.  Fair warning DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT HERE.  These review sites like Nerdwallet must be paid to write their reviews.  Run from this bank.Update 10/29 - almost two months and they have not returned my money.  Almost $2000.  This financial company is a fraud.Update 11/5 - response from support email is to use app for response.  Novo shut down the account and password.  There is no way to contact these jokers.  We are preparing a lawsuit and making formal complaints with State and Federal banking regulators.  This type of predatory bank is illegal.  They have my phone number I gave it when I setup the account.  If they were truly trying to resolve the issues they would reach out.  All these review sites that give them positive reviews are paid reviews.  There are legitimate online banks but this is not one of them.11/16/2022No response to this case number at all.   Two months and I still don't have a check from these people.  Do not put your money here.  All I've gotten from them is message they sent a check that was months ago and a message confirming my address.  Never do the respond to my request they apparently done have phones because they can't be bothered to call and resolve the situation.12/7/2022 UpdateStill no check from NOVO.  3 months.  I have confirmed my 2 addresses with them all they ever say is we sent a check.  That is a lie or if you sent the check it never arrived and NOVO has an obligation to reissue the check.  It is not their money and it must be returned.  Sometimes I will get an email when I post reviews here or facebook or other places.  They have my phone number I have asked them to call several times not once do they call.  I respond to every email they send but never receive a response to my reply email.  Then in a couple weeks another automated email how was your support experience.  Support is NON-EXSISTENT.  Do not do business here you have been warned.12/10/2022Funny when every I post new complaints and reviews this company emails us but it never resolves the issue and send a check.    NOVO emails us claiming we never responded to their 11/21 email which is false.  We again sent a email with the 11/22 email attached.  Again asked that they call and resolve the issue.  12/9/2022 we filed a formal complaint against Middlesex Federal Savings (MFS).  Novo bank is listed as a branch of MFS on the FDIC's website.  We are also working formal complaints to be filed with banking regulators in the states of FL, WY and MA which all have nexus based on theirs and our business operations.  These two entities Middlesex Federal Saving and NOVO Bank are dishonest and I implore you not to do business with them.  The chance is high based on reviews you will have a nightmare in dealing with them.  Any company that won't provide a phone number for support should really raise a red flag.\n",
            " - Novo has consistently helped us with our business bank account needs.\n",
            " - Understandably, Novo requires a specific signature on checks for deposit. However, if you mess up in any way you won’t be able to deposit your check. There also isn’t any way to mail the check in for deposit in this situation. I was also disappointed with their customer service rep. as she didn’t offer any further steps to help me. I ended up getting a reissued check and depositing it at a different bank.\n",
            " - Fraud protection is borderline nonexistent at Novo.  May 28th (holiday weekend), my business banking was drained to 0 balance with a series of 50+ charges on my Novo card.  I never even had a physical card.  They began small and then ramped up.  Once the larger charges were rejected, they went down again until my balance was under 10 dollars.  They requested I click to file fraud on every single transaction (about 5 clicks each).  There is no such thing as phone support.  Today is 9/14 and I've received ~150 dollars back of the approximately $4000 in fraud charges. Novo keeps reiterating that it can take up to 120 days for fraud investigations.  This doesn't explain how 3 charges were refunded so far but the rest have not closed out.  Doesn't explain how that many transactions at the same place in a single day, that were obviously structured were allowed to go through. Even if in 2 weeks (120 days) I receive the remainder back it slowed business growth drastically over the last 4 months with being unable to purchase equipment.  Their interface is slick, their integration is great but when push comes to shove the bank behind the curtain has serious problems.\n",
            " - Novo is the absolute worst bank ever.  I had a $1,200 fraudulent charge on my account from a business in England!!! I reported it immediately to Novo as fraud and they will not refund the charge.  I personally contacted the business in England that took the money and they said that Novo never disputed the fraudulent charge or they would have investigated it.  Over 120 days have gone by and since it is not a personal account by law they do not have to refund the fraudulent charge that they let go through from overseas!Beware do not put any money in this bank that you want to keep.They will not answer any questions on the theft.  worst mistake ever.  I will never open another bank account from a place that does not have a branch office that I can go to..Beware!!!i HAVE ALL THE DOCUMENTATION TO BACK THIS CLAIM UP.\n",
            " - Guys!!! Pay attention to these reviews. All the good ones say invited!I guarantee they are fake. Any of them that actually have bad reviews dont say that and we are just trying to warn you so please listen. Last week I did 2 instant transfersFrom 2 separate payment platforms. They never made it into my account, just disappeared. Bank is saying that 2 separate payment platforms messed up on the same day and it’s the platforms fault. I literally can’t talk to anyone, go ahead and look it up. Try to find a phone number. You have to communicate via messenger through there app. They refuse to give me a number so I can actually talk to someone that can handle this issue. They just keep sending me the same message over and over every time I try to ask where my money is. Run away from this bank. These deposits weren’t small, they owe me a lot of money and just don’t care.\n",
            " - This bank is a front for Middlesex Federal bank- a small regional bank who are lending their regulatory status to this \"business platform.\"  I had to escalate my concerns to an extreme level in order to be refunded money from nearly $7000 is fraudulent transactions that I immediately flagged.  I cancelled the card but within days the card was still live and more transactions piled on.  I finally won but only after literally calling executives at Middlesex Federal who deny they have any control of NOVO, which is false.   I now have two transactions from weeks ago (modest amounts compared to the prior fraud).  Again I flagged them as fraud within a day of their hitting my account. They are from a business in Abu Dhabi that is clearly a front for fraud.  No action taken by NOVO after weeks. I get messages that make no sense by email stating that I did not respond to their so called \"support\".  I did respond but they did not act or respond or engage in any dialog. The \"bank\" is treating obvious frauds as \"chargebacks\".  They rely on the relatively lax controls over business debit cards to ignore their fiduciary obligations.   I suggest that anyone who experiencing the same issues I have should contact the office of the UC Comptroller and register complaint.  This so called bank has a decent \"platform\" in terms of software.  It is a joke as a bank and not a secure environment, period.  Run don't walk.  I hope an attorney is preparing a class action, which I would gladly join.\n",
            " - Novo's system is great but lacks speed in sending replacement cards when lost or stolen. It will be a 30 day wait and that can he a little tough for some small business owners to go without a card for 30 days. Besides the card replacement speed they are great. The app is perfect and has a modern feel to it, it shows expenses, income and more.\n",
            " - I'm very happy to have Novo Bank as my business banking partner. I appreciate the mobile app, the speed of the system, and the ease in reviewing my transactions.I only wish Novo Bank had a way for me to deposit cash into my account without having to get a money order or check - it takes a few days for checks that are deposited to be credited to my account, which is inconvenient when I need the deposit to be credited more quickly.\n",
            " - Novo made opening and maintaining my new Business account easy and hassle free. I have been with them for years and don’t plan on going anywhere 😍\n",
            " - Unsatisfied, I am switching away from Novo. I told them that I'm disappointed and I'm switching away. The next week they sent me an email asking me to post a review on Trustpilot. Here it is:Avoid NOVO. :-(Novo declined two separate deposits recently. Both were checks from customers. I had nobody to speak to about these problems, but I could access live chat during their business hours or send emails. When I asked WHY each check was denied, they told me in one case \"the time is not negotiable.\"  I asked what that meant, because the date was clear on the check. I was able to deposit both of these checks without incident at my local credit union -- even after needing to alter the endorsement that I had originally prepared for Novo.From what I can tell, NOVO is a software front end for another bank. When things go well, they are great.  But when things to wrong you're stuck dealing with the people who work for the software company and not the bank.  If the software people (NOVO) can't help you, that's a dead end. Also, I think the NOVO people are nice, but it feels like they're moving too fast and making mistakes. For instance with my deposit problems which occurred on different days, they decided to group them together. So when I said \"hey you declined another deposit, can you tell me why this time?\" they didn't read anything and just grouped it with the last one.\n",
            " - Terrible bank. They closed my account and didnt even give me any reason for this. I only found out when I got payment sent from a Vendor and tried to log in only to find out my account was closed, I emailed and they said oops sorry, we wont do business with you anymore. Completely asnine. The support is terrible, my support guy was named Checkie, LOL.THEY WRITE FAKE REVIEWS.\n",
            " - I love having a business account with Novo Bank because they have superb, thorough, and caring customer support representatives! Bank with Novo, and bank with professionals!\n",
            " - I am very surprised by the number of bad reviews I have read on here, but the one consistent thing I see in the bad reviews that I agree with is Novo's strict rules regarding acceptance of checks. I have never in my entire life had a bank tell me that a check isn't acceptable because it has been \"altered\" and then not tell me what was altered about it and completely refuse to give me any information about what is wrong with the check which was a professional business check that would be accepted by any other bank. Novo put me in a very awkward position with a client of mine where I had to tell them I could not accept their check, but then not be able to tell them WHY I couldn't accept their check. I assumed that if they issued me a new one, it would have the same problem as the old one so I had to make this professional business VENMO ME to pay me which was extremely embarrassing.With that said, I have only had this issue one time so far and I hope to never have it again or these stars on my review will continue to go down! Novo, you need to wake up and figure out a better check processing system. Your rules are truly insane and your lack of communication about issues with completely acceptable checks is unacceptable.With that said, everything else about this online bank is great. I love the app. I have always had quick responses from customer support. This business bank is exactly what I needed as a freelancer.\n",
            " - Working with this \"bank\" is the worst, most stressful experience since becoming a business owner. I really wanted to start off in the right foot but this \"bank\" is making it very difficult for me. I instant transferred money from my venmo to novo virtual card, it's been 5 days now that my funds are missing. Venmo was really easy to work with and super helpful, unfortunately since it's out of their hands, I have to deal with novo and it is like pulling teeth. Extremely slow customer service. No answers to my questions. I am extremely unhappy and will be looking into a lawyer if I don't see my money really soon.\n",
            " - If I could give ZERO stars I would. I was liking novo until my account was charged on separate occasions with UNAUTHORIZED transactions. I had over 1.2k STOLEN from my account and I’m nearing the 120 day mark with no update. As a small business owner who’s still growing it’s so disgusting to have your hard earned money STOLEN and a “bank” doing not even the bare minimum. No number to call, slow customer service, horrible platform I opened up an account with chase. If I don’t get my money back I’ll be looking to press charges\n",
            " - I run a small business and my experience with Novo has been great. A $50 minimum deposit was needed which they clearly stated. I deposited two legit mobile checks and I received my funds. Novo sent me an email stating since I was a new business they will hold my checks for two days and then deposit them into my account. As Novo stated, my checks were deposited within two business days. These reviews scared me but I think for myself and I decided to give Novo a try. Now either these reviews are a smear campaign or some of these \"customers\" were attempting to upload fake checks. Have some integrity and speak the truth because you wouldn't want someone to tarnish your business.\n",
            " - I opened a novo acct for my business and my wife opened one for hers. They are not  professional to deal with. You can NEVER get someone on the phone during the week and If it's the weekend forget about it. They're closed. My wife received an ACH deposit on Friday for $2,500 and needed to transfer most of it to another bank. Since Novo doesn't use Zelle she had to make a $1,000 withdraw and deposit that at her other bank. When she went to do the same on Saturday suddenly the rest of the money was placed in \"pending\" status for no reason. It's a holiday weekend and now she cannot get access to the money until Tuesday. We are both canceling Novo. They're not a real bank. Just another internet wannabe company that makes life more difficult target than solving a problem.\n",
            " - Numerous, numerous problems simply trying to transfer from my bank to novo, getting verified, sending photos of checks, you name it. After setting up both online and through the Novo app, connecting my bank, verifying test deposits, and then trying a transfer, it would always always hang up on something. First tried direct bank to Novo transfer of $1000+, but it said only $600 limit unless I used the Novo app. So I tried the Novo app, but numerous problems again, first with direct transfer, second with a check taking front and back photos.But it still couldn't direct transfer, couldn't focus on back of check (against dark background as it required), wouldn't manually focus, then when it finally accepted photos, I would get an error \"Something Went Wrong\" and would take me to Review Transfer. Here it would show the checks front and back, but the amount to transfer had reset to zero. No way to re-enter a transfer amount without starting entire transfer over again -- which I did about 10 times with no luck. Tried contacting them many times, only response is email saying \"Here are a few support questions that might help\". Serious problems with Novo. How can they expect me to trust them for the numerous future transfers I need to make???\n",
            " - I have open this account at the beginning of the year hoping to start a good year with my business. But when I started to use my debit card, especially to pump gas so I can keep working, it was often declined, which at that point was fine because I see it as a protection.  However, the day I was waiting a new large deposit from a client as soon as the deposit comes In I recieved another notification of a successful transaction made with my virtual card for 1,498.98 usd ... location Dubai? I AM IN USA!!  .... how it comes they declined 20 dollars at the pump and they let a $1498.98 transaction goes trough? Are you serious, what kind of protection is that? I been robbed and they just say I have to wait from 10days to 120days for this to be resolved while they investigate, I want my money now!Is stated on novo bank website you have protection for your customers, where is it. And by the way they do have a phone number, use the one on the back of your card.I will be on all social media giving you a bad reviews if you're do not solve my case!\n",
            " - This company shouldn't be able to exist.  They denied some small charges to my REAL debit card, supposedly for security purposes.  BUT....they allowed my VIRTUAL card to be hacked for a significant amount of money, without any stop-gaps at all.  Now all that I'm getting are BS answers via the app and canned emails.  Can't speak to a real person at all.  So far it's been almost 3 weeks and it has put me in a bad financial situation.  My account will definitely be closed when this is resolved.  I've been hacked before (at a brick-and-mortar) but filed the report and received my money back in a day or two.  Don't use this bank!  They aren't equipped to be a bank for small businesses.\n",
            " - Reply from NovoA day agoHi,We're sorry our deposit times did not meet your expectations, but our agents are available at the phone number on the back of your debit card. We are also available through the support function in your app to discuss faster funding options!My responses back to Novo bank (1) You have terrible customer service, rarely answer your phones? I don't understand this\"Low\" level of customer service? (2) You make it difficult for customers to close their accounts (3) You take way too long to allow people to have access to their money and take (At least a week) to clear a small $10.00 check! Really? (4) The bank website doesn't look professional and is somewhat juvenile. (5) You don't explain up front on the individual bank account website what kind of business relationship you have with Middlesex Federal FA. (6) Disclosure statements are not located within the individual bank account view of the banking website. (7) You don't make it easy to deposit cash? (8) No advance banking services and products for higher revenue businesses!Again for those that are reading this and are serious about building a successful business “DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME”!  Start your business off on the right foot by doing business with a business focus financial institution where you can build a long-term business relationship with good customer service, business loans, a business advisor, high-interest paying accounts, credit cards, retirement accounts, and so on. NOVO bank is not a bank that you want to start off trying to build a successful business with. They don't offer a lot of the financial tools a true business owner needs to grow a successful business!Note: There are many well known business focus banks that have business checking accounts that can be opened up with $0.00 and provide many banking products and services for a \"Kitchen Table\" startup business to a large corporation!Final comment. NOVO bank is a bank for those that chose to run their business like a “Side Hustle”\n",
            " - Wish I read the reviews here before signing up with Novo and attempting to deposit a check. Novo denied my check because it was \"altered\". When asked what was altered about it they couldn't tell me, but they did leave a hint that it was not the endorsement.. (so what is it!?) It's impossible to talk to a real human on the phone and the agents on the chat respond just once a day. So I'm left with a check that has \"Mobile Deposit at Novo\" written on the back (per their instructions) and now can't deposit it at another bank. I already closed my account, avoid at all costs.\n",
            " - I am a nonprofit so can’t afford to have any money going missing. But it keeps happening! Unauthorized charges on both my old and new issued debit card AND the virtual card. They don’t refund the money, it’s in ‘dispute’ forever. I’m not initiating these charges and I need my money. So frustrating! And you can’t talk to a live person ever. Ugh\n",
            " - RUN, don't walk. Will refused to deposit reputable business checks with no reason (and they are now marked for NOVO mobile deposit only/unusable), just suggestion from chat bots to use several forms of mobile deposits they clearly have affiliations with. No customer service, you can only chat with a bot. Sometimes long response times, but comments the same. We don't have to tell you why, have your clients re-deposit using these great 3-rd party payment options. What a nighmare. Several checks were certified, issuing client is still dealing with getting new ones. Has tied up substantial funds and issues both for mystery check declines and now needing a new bank to deposit most recent ones. WHAT A NIGHTMARE AS A BUSINESS OWNER. Be prepared to ask your clients for new checks and explain why you would use a bank like this.\n",
            " - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BANK.I was fooled by the marketing hype and chose this bank for my startup business and regretted it. I am trying to close my account with them and that is proving to be difficult too. :(A few of the issues I had:NO contact information, phone, or help on web site.Excessively LONG holds on check deposits.No check images.Statements have very limited information.Statement downloads have errors in file name dates, causing company accounting issues.Checks are rejected for very little issues, when we never had any issues with rejected checks for our other bank or my personal bank.This bank is just a web middleman, they operate out of another bank and are poorly setup and poorly operated with Zero customer service Zero care for their customers. Dont waste your time.\n",
            " - Wouldn't recommend at all, recently opened up a business account and started depositing 2 small checks from my company just to see the processing times and clearance rather than just quickly despoiling my larger checks over 1k. One check was $441 and the other was for $479 (both printed checks was from the same HOA management company) somehow the check for $479 was rejected, they would not tell me why and just told me to request a new check from the vendor or have them do a ACH transfer, I own a commercial cleaning business so 99% of my payments are by check from these other company’s I’ve never had a check reject in my 3 years of owning this business as I only deal with larger reputable companies so that was flag number 1. Once the check in the amount of $441 cleared I tried sending money using the virtual card on the app, novo kept declining the transaction even though the money was cleared, so I waited a few days until I got the physical debit card and tried activating and it would not activate contacted support (customer support is horrible seems like they send the same prewritten responses) and found out my account is frozen which caught me by surprise, I keep asking for information to why it’s frozen, and I keep getting a generic response “your account is currently frozen and under review, while under review we can’t provide any information or give you a time frame until the review is complete” so It’s been 2 weeks and my account is still under review mind you I have funds in the account I clearly can’t access, they will not tell me why the account is frozen, they keep saying they don’t know how long the review will take and can’t provide a estimate time, like this is crazy, I’m currently looking into legal action as I believe this company is a fraud/ scam and based on other reviews, I’ve seen they are several people that this same situation has happened to and they are going on months with their accounts still be frozen and no access to fund for whatever reason novo decided to freeze, not sure a new account, with no transactions, no activity is placed on freeze and not given any information as to why, I’ve had other real business bank accounts and if they were frozen I was given information as to why so that I could either verify identity or provide documentation to unfreeze the account as you are legally required ti provide. NOT THE CASE WITH NOVO!!! Refusing to give any information or resolve the issue so please don’t bank with them, they will be hearing from my lawyer as he is preparing my case by this fraudulent company.\n",
            " - I had a fraudulant charge to my account, usually easily taken care of. Its been 4 months now and all I ever hear from support is they have 120 days to resolve the issue.  Better believe that take every damn day to. I am told today that there will be a resolution by the end of next week, which is almost to the day, 120 days. They told me its on the merchant and theres nothing they can do. Got the same generic email 10 times, every time Ive asked about it. This is only for $111. I will be closing my account and moving my business account. I cant imagine if a real issue ever came up what kind of customer service theyd have. I have never been told by any real bank that being protected against fruad would take so long. This company is useless for real businesses.\n",
            " - DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! I THINK THEYRE A FRAUD COMPANY SO DONT SEND THEM YOUR BUSINESS DOCUMENTS..THEY JUST KEEP ASKING YOU FOR MORE AND MORE DOCUMENTSResponse: been there, did that..time waster!!\n",
            " - Quite possibly the WORST online bank I've ever dealt with. Use anyone else but them. They froze my account, canceled it and never gave a reason. I had over $40k in there and they have done nothing to help me. I am not to receive a check in 15-45 days. I run a small business and my tax payment didn't go thru now I'm going to be late. USE ANYONE BUT NOVO!\n",
            " - I would give zero stars if I could. Do not use this bank for your small business! My account was compromised twice and they are nearly impossible to get ahold of to correct issues like this. There is no 800 number and they do not respond promptly to emails.\n",
            " - Terrible bank.  I accidentally sent a larger transfer back to my old Azlo account.  I tried to contact someone, no luck, no phone numbers, no real people on chat, etc.  I used the support ticket option in the app to try and receive help, and got a canned response 2 days later from what appears to be a \"bot\" with no real info in it.  They basically told me \"sorry\".  F&ck these people.  I am going back to Chase.\n",
            " - I wanted to love it but novo has terrible customer service and if you want to deposit checks digitally, it won't happen.As another reviewer pointed out, they reject your checks and you have to embarrass yourself by asking your client for a new check....Novo gives no reason behind what is wrong or why the check is rejected..... run far away if you need a bank in your corner, novo is terrible!!\n",
            " - Horrible company, business was declined for an account and they offer NO reason at all, we contacted the support and they sent back a copy paste response we ask them to be specific and they ignore all future emails.\n",
            " - I have been with novo for almost a year. With no notice. Novo froze and canceled the bank account with no notice and no explanation.  They refuse to release my funds. When your a small business you have bills to pay. This is bad business.  If you have a bank account with novo. I would not keep alot of money in the account. They may close the account with no notice and tie up your money for ever and you may never get it back. I would not bank with this company. It could be a scam.\n",
            " - The absolutely worse banking experience ever. The manager doesn't respond to emails or circumstances and hides behind her team. They don't have a contact number or chat to resolve problems. You can only respond via their horrible mobile app. Very unprofessional organization. After closing our account they sent the balance of our account to an account that does not belong to us, without our knowledge or permission. So our attorney will be filing a lawsuit for sure. This is the worst banking experience I've ever encountered. You've been warned.\n",
            " - Novo looks nice, but they have a very poor customer service and all of my correspondence were basically generic and diverting responses from them. I asked to speak with a supervisor 4 times and they would just divert to a FAQ page. I would highly advise any small business owner to stay away, you don’t need to waste your time.\n",
            " - Customer service is pathetic. Bank will make an arbitrary decision that affects clients’ finances and causes frustration and headache, and only way to attempt to resolve it is a slow, maddeningly frustrating chat conversation half the time with a bot. Mobile deposit is your only option. Forget cashing a check. 3 months for me to get their pos debit card. No check book.Terrible. Awful. Just use a brick and mortar bank.\n",
            " - Novo rejected a mobile deposit after I endorsed it to Novo per their instructions. The check was from a company that Novo had previously approved for a mobile deposit, and the amount was far less this time. The support rep told me I would have to ask the company for another check. I did and they sent me a second check. Again, rejected by Novo. These checks are payments for work I did for the company. I am so embarrassed I have to go back to them again and tell them their check was rejected.  This is a publicly traded company worth billions, and here I am asking them for a third payment. Novo won't even tell me why the checks are being rejected. And they do not have a support phone number, so their responses through chat are not helpful at all. Closing my account and will leave negative reviews all over the web. Do not use this \"bank\" if you are a small business owner because they will burn you.\n",
            " - Unacceptably terrible customer service. They are not even technically a \"bank\". They call themselves a bank, but when you press them they say they are a technology platform to interface with another bank. Their technology could not accept a check, because it was a slightly different size than a normal check. No matter what I did, there was no way to resolve the issue. I would've mailed to to them, but they aren't a bank, so they wouldn't accept it. I would've tried to manually verify the check, but they aren't a bank, and their check verification is handled by another company.Truly, you should avoid this company. There are plenty of other legitimate banks, who are actual banks, out there.\n",
            " - Once again. Gave Novo one more chance. And again, no funds available, after depositing my second big check with them. I’m not impressed at all. I will be closing my account, once I get my funds out. And find another bank.\n",
            " - I opened an account to do one thing:  cash paychecks from my small business.  I have one client, so every check is identical except for small variations in the amount (generally $1500-2500).  This month Novo refuses to let me deposit my check, won’t tell me why, the online customer service ignores me and they have NO TELEPHONE SUPPORT.  That makes this place useless to me.  I don’t know who wants ti use a bank that will randomly refuse to deposit your pay check for no reason.  I am done with this place.\n",
            " - Absolutely horrible bank! Save your sanity and bank elsewhere. We opened a business account, and have a card for two people. Every time we try to use the card it’s declined. We have to submit a support ticket just for agents to send us in circles. They say we are over our daily transaction limit-  not true…. They tell us we are over our daily spending limit —- again not true! They are now holding almost $1k from us, and all transactions are being declined. We also are not able to take out money from the bank. Yet again, I’m awaiting a response from my recent support ticket. Use a real bank, because Novo will do nothing but give you a headache and illegally hold onto your money for no reason.\n",
            " - My experience w Novo has been a migraine headache of EPIC proportions and I'll be getting my funds out of this bank ASAP. Back in June I made a deposit from another bank to my Novo account for my car payment. I sent more than enough to cover the payment, however Novo took a week to post the funds to the account unbeknownst to me, and the payment was rejected. Next thing you know, 2 wks later the bank has repo'ed my car, but I can't call Novo because they don't have a regular CS line and everything is handled via messages on their app...not even on their website. If you're lucky enough to get a quick response (because you probably won't...usually have to wait a couple of hours or more), you're met with a CS rep who copies a rote response from a script and subsequently closes your ticket. Meanwhile, I go ahead and make an Express ACH payment through the Novo website to the bank my car is financed by, and pay the extra $20 for the service so the funds are expedited. Here we are, 2 days later and the auto financing still has no trace of any payment from me, pending or otherwise, while my car languishes at an impound somewhere, racking up daily fees. While this is going on, I am obligated to rent a car to get to work and doctors appts. (I am a cancer patient), so this is really beginning to add up, all while I remain waiting for someone, ANYONE at Novo to get back to me and tell me where the hell my money is. As soon as this matter is put to rest I am getting my money out of Novo, shutting my account down and going to another bank, effective immediately.\n",
            " - So far its been a pretty bad experience.  I have 4 companies and opened up an account for each.  After adding funds to the accounts I noticed that one was named incorrectly.  Turns out their system decided to not use the state LLC formation docs we uploaded and to just rename it to another one of my LLC's which I didn't upload docs for.  After a week of back and forth messages (Their support is minimal and ONLY VIA PHONE APP CHAT) I get them what they need and they assure me they have changed the name to what it should be.  A month goes by and I check the account and turns out they never changed it.  I've sent them multiple chats asking what happened and no one has gotten back to me.  We will be moving all of our accounts back to our old bank and just pay the monthly fees.  At least they offer support.\n",
            " - Everything was running very smoothly, then we received an ACH from one of our customers which should be available immediately. It showed as such, then the bank put it on hold and my overall balance is correct, but my available balance is not. I called the company, and the person I spoke to Janis told me she cannot look at my account, and that someone will get back to me in a few days. What kind of garbage is this? The company is owned by Middlesex Bank, and they are not helpful either. I think this company is possible a scam! They have several thousand dollars of our money tied up. This is clearly not acceptable and in violation of banking laws.\n",
            " - USE A DIFFERENT BANKI lost my debit card. Their 'fraud protection' is in a different country and didn't even know Novo was a bankGot the actual number to speak with a human. (617-666-4700 or 844-260-6800) Andrew didn't know ANYTHING about the bank. Not even if they are FDIC insured. He was rude and not helpful in the least. After an hour and a half of playing games with them, I still don't have a debit card.At this point, it's moot. I will never allow this company ANY access to my money. What a TERRIBLE company full of people who just dgaf.\n",
            " - They have locked my business account with no explanation or next steps! They have zero communication with me. I have $20,000 frozen. I contacted my lawyer this morning! Then someone from their company reviews my LinkedIn in profile!?\n",
            " - The noise to signal ratio is ridiculous. The only way to communicate with customer service is email, which, being a non-urgent means of communication, drags out for hours and days resolving a question that could have been answered by live chat or phone in two minutes. If the customer service rep who answered the email has reading comprehension issues and instead of your question answers a question no one asked, you need to reply and wait for another answer for hours or days. There are no other options to contact this bank. Meanwhile, they absolutely bury you in auto-generated, meaningless emails that flood your business inbox. They are truly obsessed with email. It’s disturbing, not to mention disruptive to your business. I ended up closing our account before we even made use of it, so this review is solely about the unsustainable communications.\n",
            " - DO NOT USE THIS BANK. I have lost my housing because of this bank. They absolutely destroyed my life because they closed my account for no reason and still have not sent me my money in over 2 months. There is no accountability, no apology, no actual human I have even gotten a hold of. Everyone who works for this company should be ashamed of themselves. I hope this bank fails, crumbles, and is no longer able to inflict this suffering on another customer.\n",
            " - IF YOUR READING THIS PLEASE PLEASE DONT MAKE A NOVO ACCOUNT, THEY LITERALLY CLOSED MY ACCOUNT FOR NO REASON AND DIDN’T TELL ME WHY. PLEASE DONT USE NOVO ACCOUNT TRY SOMEWHERE ELSE DONT USE NOVO BANK ACCOUNT AT ALL!!!!!!!\n",
            " - Really not impressed with any Bank that doesn't offer Instant Transfers. Virtual card wouldn't work with CashApp or Uber but the Authorizing Zero dollar charge Push notifications were popping up meaning they're just blocked from happening. Instant transfers are a life line for any small business. Would not recommend this account to anyone unless they were to partner with a much better bank. If you like online banks I recommend Found. Although they for some reason got rid of Mobile Deposit instant transfers work with your Physical or Virtual Cards, I've transferred thousands around. They've always answered the phone within moments of calling them and funds hit your account as soon as the parent bank receives them. Sorry Novo there's no chance I would ever come back even if you were to get your act together....\n",
            " - I wish I could give less than a 1 star. Whoever has created a mobile deposit app needs to go back to elementary to learn. It's a nightmare to deposit a check. Constantly rejecting the images which doesn't make any freakin sense. While many banks nowadays instantly funds your account, NOVO takes act congress to make that happen. Simply Horrible & pathetic!\n",
            " - Really terrible customer service. It's impossible to get anyone on the phone. I sent money to my business account using Wise and it was immediately pulled out of the account by Novo. When I wrote to them, they said it was going to reappear within 1 day. It did not return and the money is now missing. I have no choice but to close the account, it has been a complete waste of time and also either fraudulent or extremely poorly run. As soon as I mentioned this in a support chat, the thread would be closed and they would say someone else is looking into it.\n",
            " - The absolute worst bank i have ever dealt with in my life, and i have dealt with many banks.  They take forever to fund checks and most of the deposits are rejected for no good reason at all.  i have been trying to deposit a single check with them for over a month with no luck.  Finally, they told me that they were closing my account and weren't allowed to tell me why.  Save yourself the aggravation that i had gone thru and stay away from this terrible bank!\n",
            " - UPDATE after Novo's reply: Novo's reply shows further evidence of the incompetence you'll have to deal with if you open an account with them. Clearly the person who responded did not read my review as I clearly stated one of the problems I had with them was getting my debit card replaced (which is one of the places they state I can get the support phone number). Additionally, what this person did not say is that even if you happen to get ahold of the phone number, you need an active account number to reach a person. You'll be prompted to enter an account number before getting transferred to someone and if the account has been closed you'll get a message that you have to email support and then you'll get hung up on.BEWARE. I have wasted hours upon hours of my time trying to accomplish basic banking tasks with Novo. For example, I needed my debit card replaced and called the number listed on their site for that specific task. The woman who answered asked me what company I was trying to reach (it seemed like she didn't actually work for Novo and was handling calls for a bunch of different companies), she couldn't locate my account, and said she couldn't help me. After several frustrating interactions like that with them, I found a new, better bank. I've requested a closing statement (which they are required to provide by law since I had EFT transactions during the period), and they are refusing to send me one. There is also no way to speak with customer service unless you are an active customer. STAY AWAY from this so-called bank. There's a big reason they're free--it will cost you more in time than any other bank could ever charge in fees. There are so many other options out there (ex: BlueVine, CapitalOne, etc.).\n",
            " - 3pm Update... a few hours later... before my review below went live, i recieved a msg that my limit had gotten updated... this time only the monthly, almost got aggravated, but it chatted back to please raise daily as well... about 3 hours later, it was raised.... maybe there is hope yet.I am going to leave the below review unaltered... Disappointment comes with unfulfilled expectations. So, set your expectations accordingly.Novo was easy to setup, and easy to use online, with several free integrations... so, if you proceed,. just go plan ahead as much as possible, and plan on excercising your patience when you need urgency.Raised from 1 to 310amNovo is great if you start transfering money 15 to 30 days before you actually need it.  I am at day 10 currently.  I put $xxx,xxx,xxx.xx into novo, and they kindly approved by transfer limit increases.  There is only one raise option to request at a time... per transaction, daily, or monthly.  Thankfully, the first 'bot' that approved my limit increase, could tell that a daily increase approval needed the corresponding monthly increase.  The standard limit is $xxxx.xx... I appreciate the possible fraud protection, but I can't do much business with that.Not this time... approved my daily increase... but left the monthly limit the same... almost funny.So... when you're losing thousands of dollars a day because a transaction wont fund because of 'bot' incompetence... you are going to want to talk to someone.Again, not here... it will be three days before you get an email, then three more for a response to ask if its correct, then three more for 'bot' implementation.Hehe.Jokes on me for thinking I could give a 'chat bot' almost $xxx,xxx,xxx and expect a good outcome.Lesson learned.Edit about 30 min later... I think everyone should have a go with novo... then there will a massive driving force of people to FIX this chat bot mentality of customer service... everyone who thinks they have a good app idea is using it along with minimal support to go out and get rich... maybe stick to making games... my kids will love it.(the next generation could use some exercises in delayed gratification)\n",
            " - I can’t get a hold of anyone to close my account and access my money. I can’t verify my account as my business is now closed, and I no longer have the associated phone number or email address. The phone number on my debit card requires the account number (which isn’t my debit card number I guess) and then says to email them if you have issues, and the emails don’t even go through. I need someone to contact me so I can verify my identify and access my account!\n",
            " - I am very unhappy with this  bank, they are really just a middleman web front, and I dont think they even handle the money, as transactions are posted to some other bank in Mass. I guess that why it takes them so long to clear deposits and respond to customer service requests, because they have to go through someone else. And their responses to these reviews are just plain hype and most are untrue. Not recommended at all. :(\n",
            " - If you value customer service I don’t recommend Novo. My bank account had over $1000 in fraudulent activity and I have to navigate it through robotic copy and paste answers by the customer service texts. Stick to a bank you can pick the phone up to when there is a problem like your account being emptied.We have an online bank for our personal and we can call them when we have a problem. We’ve been with them for years, so it’s not that it’s an online bank, it’s the way they have structured contact.\n",
            " - This is an absolutely terrible \"bank\". I've been with them for a few years, ever since azlo closed and they poached a lot of their small biz customers. the difference between azlo and novo is night and day. for one, with novo they make it nearly impossible to reach someone. they have a number on the back of the card that - should no one be available to take your call (in the middle of business day hours) they ask you to leave a voice mail - which they never respond to. then, their live chat thing is totally horrible. this is a BANK, with actual MONEY - and you can't reach someone during business hours by any means. As of this week (may 31st and onward) Novo has a new option for \"Express ACH\" and there a \"standard ACH\" as well. with express you pay 1.5% up to 15 dollars on a transaction to receive the money same day, or next day, with the standard option taking up to 3 business days. will guess what? before there was an express option, ALL ACH TRANSACTIONS POSTED TO MY ACCOUNT IN ONE BUSINESS DAY - so they're blatantly lying now about \"no fees\" - there is a 1.5% fee to do what used to be free. I used to recommend novo to anyone starting a small business account and at this point I couldn't get my money out of my account any faster. when this 'express transaction' posts to my account (in what looks to be 3 business days, actually... absolutely crazy), I will take the rest of the money out of the account, and never work with Novo again.\n",
            " - If you care about customer support or simple task like using your account to pay lease, stay far away. This company has issues with Pre-Note authorizations which is a zero dollar test to validate bank account information. I've never had a bank with this issue. I am not able receive funds via EFT because the account always fail confirmation test. Also, I cant add account and routing to pay lease because it also fails. With no ACH, I'm only able to use debit card which has really high fees to process for lease and I don't use debit cards for anything.Edit: This review was after already contacting customer support which was no help on multiple occasion. I get multiple responses about \"how everything should work\".\n",
            " - This is hands down absolutely the worst banking experience I've ever had to endure. Open an account on 5/12/2022 and got approved. On 5/13/2022 I made an instant deposit of $51.00 via PayPal because that's one of the options according to the App and my money was instantly taken from my PayPal account only to not be instantly deposited into the Novo account. After about an hour I try contacting support with no luck. 5/14/2022 I receive an email from Novo that my account has been flagged for fraudulent activities and they placed a temporary hold on the account. Keep in my mind my $51.00 deposit still hasn't arrived and Novo is telling me that they got no record of me ever depositing anything into the account. Fast forward to 5/27/2022 my account is still flagged and my deposit is sitting in the account but I can not withdraw my funds because they froze the account. Now I'm being told that they are closing the account and will not offer any explanation as to why also any funds that remain in the account afterwards will be mailed to me in 7 to 10 business days after the account is closed. 5/31/2022 the account is still opened but all transactions are frozen and they will not let me withdraw my money back to my PayPal or any bank account for that matter. This has got to be the worst bank I've ever dealt with. Customer service is absolutely rude and doesn't have a clue. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this so-called bank.\n",
            " - I am so upset. I was very excited to get his new bank and my debit card worked for one week. This week my card is being declined for everything. I can't reach anybody and this issue has been a huge inconvenience for my family. I've been with them month and I'm already over it. I can't have MY money held hostage and no way to reach anyone.\n",
            " - 5/25- response to Novo. Yes, I received completely useless information from your bank to be told it’s a civil matter. The cops aren’t going to get me my money back. MY bank should protect my account from fraudulent transaction. Yet ANOTHER request was sent requesting what information was sent in by the vendor and NOVO has yet to send this to me per my repeated requests. Instead I just receive CUT and PASTE canned responses. 5/23I had a dispute for a transaction from JANUARY . First let me state it took 122 days! NOT once was I ever contacted by anyone at the bank during this process. Today I was told the merchant won their claim and I would not be refunded. It was an $800 transaction for legal preparation in which the service was never provided. In fact I had to hire an attorney to start the process all over again. The company missed several deadlines refused to finish my file. Failed to respond to BBB and even told me to lie to the courts because the company forged my signature which is Penal code violation PC115 and classified as a felony. Yet Novo is incompetent to win this dispute. Beyond belief. Do not use them for anything but standard purchases their dispute process is a total Joke!!!\n",
            " - Please listen and let me save you from the worst banking experience I have ever had.  First I had multiple times where a deposit sat pending for weeks and I kept going round and round with them as to why.  When I already was switching banks, my debit card suddenly has fraud charges on it.  I am frantically trying to cancel it and can’t get an answer on the “24/7” line.  I was finally on the phone for the one when a second went through.  I jumped through all their hoops and contacted the vendors, they said they submitted the agreement to refund it but Novo only returned the smaller charge.  I keep asking and they say it takes a while…I am talking months.  I also sent a check through them and it never arrived and still shows pending.  No way to cancel or anything…again MONTHS later.  If you talk to their customer support, they just say they have to email another department. From my conversations everything is third party and customer service is non existent.  You can chat but if they answer and don’t just close a support ticket without an answer like they have many times, you don’t really get any help.  This is your money, park it ANYWHERE else. A mattress would be better.\n",
            " - This is not a real bank.They have no phone number, no e-mail, customer service is not allowed on a computer only on the phone app. They put 5 day hold on deposits, and it took them 10 days to process my 3 bill payments, and that was before they even mailed the check!Terrible experience.\n",
            " - WALK AWAY FROM THIS BANK NOWDon't even try to sign up! I am totally disappointed in this so-called digital bank. The sign-up and account review process are basically a joke. After my initial funding is transferred, they asked me to send over the partnership agreement in chat. Uploaded and didn't hear back for a month. Contacted them, asking me to send it over email. Sent and didn't hear back for a month. Now they are asking me to upload again via chat.So my money is stuck, business is paused and partner is irritated, all because I chose this fake bank.\n",
            " - I’m done using Novo. It’s only been about a week. I haven’t even received my initial card they “sent out”… they’re asking me to request a new one. Where is the first one?? My money is stuck on the app now because they don’t offer instant transfers to other apps.. like novo to Venmo or PayPal. You can only do 3-5 business days. If this is for small business why do you think we can afford to wait that long for funds?? Make a long story short… thanks for nothing\n",
            " - I stopped using this bank months ago after they sent a check from my account, withdrew the funds, but then bounced the check when the person cashed it. It cost me double.Now, I canceled a large purchase I had made with this account months ago and it was refunded to the form of payment (although I fought for them to send me a check). They are now holding my funds because my account is frozen for some reason. The only way to contact them is through a stupid bot, and 3 ‘people’ have responded to my demand for a phone number with the EXACT same copy/paste response.I’m a bootstrap business. While $200 may not seem like a lot, it is to me and I NEED it now, today. I am so angry, and it just reinforces why I moved my business to Chase.\n",
            " - I have been with this bank a week. I sent 4 Venmo \" instant \" transfers on Friday May 13th 2022.NONE of them have arrived in my account at the time of this review 10:45 Monday May 16th.Venmo did refund my Instant transfer fees Novo said they can't see the payments until they hit the account but that they don't support instant payments Where is the money?About an hour after I sent the money, I started sending questions to Novo support but I did not get a response until Monday only to tell me that they don't know.  As soon as my money hits. I'm closing this account. .I highly recommend Novo if you like wondering where your money went and not getting answers.\n",
            " - Closing this account ASAP. Instant transfers from outside institutions magically take 2-3 days to appear. I have over $1300 just floating around after doing an instant transfer at 3:55 am...it is now 3:42 p.m. I have BILLS to pay that is just ridiculous. Sounds like they're making interest off of our money. It even takes almost an hour or two to receive cash app payments. Really??! Yeah they refund the $3 ATM fees but the hassle of wondering when your money will show up (or IF it will) is not worth the hassle. STEER CLEAR, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!\n",
            " - This “banking solution” is an absolute waste of time. It has good reviews so I thought I would give it a try but after 2 instances they have rejected payments and charged my account $27. Just for general knowledge my brother also owns a business and I asked him to write a check so I could see on his end how long it takes novo to take funds from “the customer” surprisingly it was fairly quick but funds sit in pending for 7 days…… what is novo doing that other Real Banks aren’t….. well a reputable bank will charge you monthly maintenance fees but funds are available not “held for suspicious reasons” I would not recommend novo to anyone and it would be best to stay away from this garbage!\n",
            " - Closed my account and notified me by email at 3pm that day- so basically no notice. They won’t explain why, or really any solid details on what the catalyst was. Not offended that they decided to terminate a business relationship, but the lack of notice cost me a few hundred in stop payment& reissue fees for payments.Update 5/16/22: Novo’s version of resolving my issue is to give the same BS answer and accomplish absolutely nothing. I wouldn’t continue banking with them irrespective of any answer, but it’s reasonable to know why they acted as such with no notice\n",
            " - We opened a legitimate business, have an EIN, active drivers license, permanent business address and a sales tax ID. We wanted to try online banking and applied online at NOVO. We had 10k as an initial deposit.For some unknown reason, we received an email denying our application. We tried unsuccessfully to reach a Novo representative. After two unanswered emails to their support email address, we gave up.Yesterday we went to Republic Bank who was happy to set up a business account for us and provide ATM access cards and business checks. I am sorry I wasted precious company time on Novo.\n",
            " - After banking with Novo for the last 8 months or so, I simply cannot understand how it is so highly rated and recommended by otherwise trustworthy sources. Hands down the worst banking experience I've ever had. It took FOREVER to set up my business account, largely because it's really difficult to reach an actual person with the bank. My checks take a full 10 days to clear and another 3 or so to transfer to our personal account. If you have a question or need help, you have to go outside your banking interface to Google it, and even then you have to go through at least 2 levels of FAQs and blog posts to get a number to call them. Just opened a new account with a local bank and can't wait to get my money out of Novo.\n",
            " - I was in the process of setting up my business and had connected my website (Shopify) and other payment options to my Novo bank account, which was easy, but when I tested a payment I found out that Novo closed my account. They did this without contacting me to alert me of the possibility of this happening. Zero communication. I have only been able to contact Novo via email. When I reached out, this was the response I received: \"We are unable to speak to the specifics around why your account was closed by our accounts team. We can say that the base of the decision is due to our risk tolerance for accounts and businesses.\" This is extremely unprofessional. I'm an independent business with only 1 employee. Not super high risk. This is all very shady and rude. I'm extremely disappointed in Novo and would not recommend them to anyone. I trusted them to be there, I got my business credit card in the mail and once I started getting payments they closed my account. Super frustrating. I'm going to a more legitimate bank and would suggest you do the same.\n",
            " - I had 2 fraudulent transactions on my business account with Novo. They did cancel my card and issue a new one. However, 7 months later, still no resolution or reimbursement of funds to my account. Business model lacks customer service and person interaction with clients. Had to eat the loss. Lesson learned. Bank with a reputable company\n",
            " - Just an email is all it took. And the reply happened in less than 24hrs.\n",
            " - Tried three times to open an account but was declined with no reason given so no way to correct information.  Had to use three different email addresses. Finally went with a local bank.  After reading the reviews it is a blessing we did not get approved by this outfit!\n",

Pandemic and PPP Loan approved through TabBank funds were deposited directly Into NovoBank.5/30/2020 all of my business and personal accounts were hacked, via account takeover and I get some bogus we are closing your account notification, etc.  Last I saw there was a very sizable balance available in this account. Novo to date hasn't produced ANY proof of withdrawal, a legitimate account statement with balance details, etc.  I contacted the US SBA, they still show active loan account, so naturally I still OWE and BankNovo and Azlo ( Now Closed can no longer help).4/2022 Apply at BankNovo, and they show I have an account with them?I have gotten absolutely nowhere with any requests of proof of my business account closure, or where the hell the funds went.  I feel scammed, without recourse and want resolution.    Please contact me directly so I can get to the bottom of this, or I will contact the necessary parties needed.  Don't shut customers away and give them absolutely no way to help themselves after a financial hacking attack occurs.  J.M\n",
            " - I have had my business account with them for about a year,  customer service by email is prompt,  They refund 3 ATM fees a month on the last day of the month,  deposits through the app are easy.  They never send cross marketing junk mails.\n",
            " - Novo is an ok bank. Most of it’s important processes are handled by another bank so it makes things like requesting a new card for my account take forever. Other than that it’s ok\n",
            " - My first mobile deposit was rejected by Novo since they said that they could not read a typed-out check.  They told me that I had to go to my client and request a new check, which is unacceptable.  I will be moving to a different bank once this issue is resolved.Update...The response from Novo to my initial review is typical of the customer service received.  No acknowledgment of their mistakes and poor service.  They did not resolve the issue in a timely manner and I did not receive the funds until nearly 2 weeks after my initial attempt to deposit the check.  After the check was finally accepted, they lied (yes...lied) about funds being available on Wednesday at 3:00 Mountain time.  They were not available until 24 hours later.  Highly recommend going with a different bank if you're a small business.\n",

When asked wth where's my money they responded by saying they closing account..  no reason no explanation. On the 9th of March was told tht a check was sent out on the 3-3-22for my discrepancies to allow 15 -20 days shoot no money back still . And they won't email me back closed my acct so I have not access to on online.. RIP OFFS........\n",
            " - Terrible service. They froze my external account from making DEPOSITS after one didn’t go through. They have to remove this hold manually and have been unable to for days. I can see them freezing withdrawals but to prevent deposits?! Im still trying to have them remove the hold they put onto my account just so I can put money in. I will be looking for a new bank after this.\n",
            " - Opened my account a year ago for my single member LLC. No issues until they bounced a payment to my 1099 employee in error. Tech support admitted their mistake but refused to take responsibility. You can't speak to a person, ever. I can't trust a bank that cannot count. Save yourself the drama and pick another bank.\n",
            " - This is a very bad customer service bank. I called in for dispute  due to card lost, and the agent told me to go to the apps and NEED to hand written a letter saying I need to dispute? So I did, and they come back with saying 120 days wait time rules, without any letter telling me anything. No reference number, not asking me to signed anything at all. By 30 days I call (never a human answer) and I went to apps, they start telling me, not able to dispute because they ask the fraud merchant PERMISSION to return and they refuse? This is about $1K , is my hard earn money. I email them a lot in the apps, they keep sending me a standardized email “saying final verdict? And look for law enforcement?” And all CLOSED my inquiry immediately. I asking for immediate reopen the dispute. Or is that police report they needed? They are not replying. I asked someone call me back never anyone contact me. All they been very busy to closed my case in the apps. I ask for documents of prove on the dispute case they never reply.  They didn’t work on my dispute case at all! This is not a bank! It never protect your rights!Updated: I called many times and they are busy to put down my phone. I asked for supervisor to speak to, they told me they do not have one, I ask for transfer call to dispute team, they telling me no dispute team to transfer, Yet they keep telling me dispute is final Not able to help, ask for documents of proof for review- what they have work on, they saying they don’t have any documents, I ask for agent ID, she saying she don’t have one,  they are rude and they just put down my phone. I putting $100K in this bank, I’m going to a proper bank. You can not joke about your money here.I have no way to turn to, apart from giving them a bad review and report to FDIC about it! They operate like a ghost bank.\n",
            " - Thank you Novo for rejecting my application for a small business checking account because you saved me all of the headaches of dealing with your horrible company.  I have decent credit and I have not had a negative issue with my personal banking accounts for well over 20 years.  Yet when I tried to sign up for a business checking account to cover my gig work -- y'all denied me because I was high undefined risk which made me unsuitable for a business checking account.  Thankfully, upon being rejected -- I did some more digging and found that all those Youtube videos praising Novo were pretty much lies.  As well, I signed up with another company and they gave me a business checking account within minutes of me making my application.  Finally, I will say that Novo totally sucks in every way possible.  You all wasted my time big time and as well attempted to insult my intelligence.  Thanks again -- because not only have you lost me as a customer -- any of my associates will be informed to not use -- or discontinue use of -- your services because it is a total waste of time and money.\n",
            " - The tech is outdated and the limits placed on business has meant that I am going back to my chase business account. However, it has taken now 4 days to try to get any money out of the account. There is no way to speak to anyone and the chat function is useless, I think they only have 3 people working for the bank. Frustrated is an understatement, stick with the major banks.\n",
            " - I opened the account thinking Novo was advanced for today's banking needs, it was disappointing to my shock 1) they didn't provide checkbooks, the virtual checks took more than 10 days to reach the recipients, no bank takes that long other than novo. I contacted the customer care and they were pretty much useless. 2) I disputed a transaction on my account and it was less than 10 - 15 days old, it took me long to create a dispute, it wasn't a one click process, and later they sent me 3-4 emails finally saying it has passed the dispute timeline. Really ? It was a recent transaction. Not even 15 days.Take my advise do not open an account in Novo. Pretty useless, all those free apps they claim are pretty lame too, all banks pretty much have those support.I might try bluevine but not sure if they will be any better, they do sound decent though.\n",
            " - Novo Bank seems like a great idea, until you have a problem that requires the intervention of a human. That’s where things fall apart because there really is no mechanism for you to speak to a human. It’s possible, too, to be completely shut out of their app, which is the only way they will communicate with you, with the simplest of circumstances.. For example, I don’t receive email on my telephone so if I’m traveling or away from my computer I can’t give you a code sent to my email. But for some reason Novo decides to do three factor identification instead of the two factor I agreed to, and send a code to both my phone and my email for verification, which leaves me without access. Even if I send them a message that says please don’t respond in the app because I can’t access the app, they sent me back a message (Which I won’t even see until later when I return to my computer) that says we’ve responded to you in the app, and they send that message sometimes as long as three or four days later. I’m standing here with my card having been eaten by a machine, the delivery date of a new card on the website listed as April 12,  a month away, unable to access the app because of the three factor authentication thing, and absolutely no way to access my own money. You souled think there be a phone number for some sort of emergency like losing your card, and there is, but it only connects you to a service that does this for them , and that service only has the phone number of Middlesex federal savings bank, which is a partner bank through which they obtain their routing number but which has no access whatsoever to their customers. So, if you plan to never have a problem, stick with Novo. If you want to be prepared for things that might happen in the future, especially while traveling, do not use this bank. While the idea of an Internet only bank sounds very modern and convenient, it is the exact opposite. Go with a brick and mortar bank with a good customer service department and a good website and you will be miles ahead of this crap.\n",
            " - On March 3, 2022 I located a customer service number to call and speak with a live person at Novo regarding receiving my 15k SBA funding for my business. In fact, I called several times during this time. On March 9th, 2022 I logged into my account to check if my funds had become available as it was confirmed that the ACH had been sent. When I logged in I noticed that there was an adjustment with a code stating closeout. This was alarming and I called in to speak with someone about it as I had not used the account in recent months. The agent at the time stated that my account was active and she didn't see any indication that something was wrong with my account and would need to reach out to another department for further assistance and I would be followed up with via the app. Well, it has now been 5 days (March 10, 2022) since my Novo business account was closed without notice. I had been in constant contact with the agents by phone and email the week prior and the beginning of the week of the 10th in regards to receiving grant funding from the SBA. I was actually happy with how helpful those agents were until I was logged out and none of my account information was recognized. I attempted to call as I had previously the day before this happened and now an automated system was in place and did not recognize my account number. This was alarming to me so I reached back out via email and called Middlesex Federal Savings who back Novo. When speaking to Middlesex I was told I was not on the call list to call and was added at the time of the phone call which was on March 10,2022. I also sent a few emails and received a response almost immediately that my account had been closed due to an overdraft of $65.66. I immediately responded and have yet to hear back from them I was never advised of the overdraft and would have taken care of it and would like to receive my funds as I think this is not good business practice. I also requested to speak with a manager and sent and email on yesterday. Still no word.\n",
            " - Seems to be easy to open an account with Bank Novo, but when there are problems they are impossible to deal with.  Received a fraud notification.  Responded immediately, however they allowed one of the transactions to go through, despite my response.  They offer no phone support at all.  Only email support and the responses read as though English is there fifth language.  Months go by with promises of returning the funds, but it never happened.  Closed account and will never return.\n",
            " - Had a technical issue on their site affecting mobile check deposits. I contacted them via support chat on the app and it is now 2 hours later and the issue is resolved! Thanks, great response...\n",

Horrible will close my account asap don’t recommend them to anyone …\n",
            " - This bank is a Fraud I would not recommend this bank to anyone. Customer service is a wish and dream , their banking practices are a joke, you can not run a business with this bank nor is your companies money safe.

DO NOT Use THEM you WILL REGRET IT !!!!!!!!\n",
            " - My experience started well with this online bank. It met my needs. No fee bank for a very simple business account where I could deposit checks and use the debit card for business expenses. Things went very wrong Dec 21, 2021. I received a VM from Novo letting me know about a possible fraud charge on my account. I checked my account. No unusually charges. To be safe I used the app to freeze my debit card. I called the number in the VM (844-682-4502) that evening and let the NOVO Fraud Theft Department know that I had not used my card and the charge was fraud. I still did not see any charges on my account at this time. I deactivated the card while on the phone with them at the same time. I contacted the merchant that I was told the charge was from and let them know the charges were being disputed. The merchandise had already been picked up and the merchant let me know my only recourse would be to contact my financial institution. I still saw no charge on my account. On Dec 22, 2021 the money was withdrawn from my account! So I called NOVO back again and was told that I would need to now dispute the charge. Remember, until then there was no charge on my account. My debit card had been deactivated. And STILL THEY LET THE CHARGE GO THROUGH 24 HOURS LATER! It is now Feb 15, 2022 and I still do not have my $1200 back! I can't talk to anyone that can tell me anything at NOVO. There only response is that the back car services are investigating the issue and have up to 120 days to respond and that I would receive an email. I have filed a police report in the town the fraud was done. After 30 days they still hadn't looked into it. I have written on the entire series of events and sent it to NOVO through the app. I have done all of the investigating myself. I told them the merchant name, what the item was, the name the person gave to fraudulently pick up the item. And still nothing? My advice. DO NOT USE THIS BANK!UPDATE: As a reply to the answer given by the BankNovo to contact them through email. As states in my review, I have been in contact with them the more not way I am able, through their app, on a very constant basis. I send a message asking for an update every 3-4 days and get the same answer every time. They assure me their dispute team is working on it and when they have an answer they will email me. And that they have up to 120 days to do this. That's it. That is as much customer service as I can get. So again. DO NOT USE THIS BANK. EVER!!!!!\n",
            " - I was so excited to join banknovo and have multiple businesses so I thought it was going to be a great experience but I’ve come to realize that it is far from that. I have tried purchasing things and every time it gets declined and there is no support agents available. When you call for support it literally just hangs up. Then I went on their website and tried contacting them but no one responds for days.I also deposited $5000 to start out and cant’t even use the funds since everything gets declined even though they told me I was good to go. Also, a very big downside of using Bank Novo is that there is no Zelle.I am happy to go back to Bank of America for all of my needs, I will probably be closing my accounts with Novo pretty soon.\n",
            " - I received a error when attempting to open an account.  Reached out to support, was able to create account.\n",
            " - Really stressful because when I signed up I had to use the address on my id and I no longer live in that house. So my debit card went there and I have no way to get the card… and supposedly that’s the only way I can contact support I did a survey that I as supposed to be paid $30 and can’t get a straight answer through the chat and no way to call this is bs how can it be a security issue to not list a support number??? Total bs\n",
            " - I wish websites would stop referring small business owners to Novo as a bank account option. It’s the most basic bank account (if you even want to call it that) than any other bank I’ve used. Firstly, it takes DAYS for most transactions to clear. The app itself is often misleading as far as how much money you have coming out when you have pending transactions. Oftentimes, the available balance doesn’t reflect what’s currently pending so you’ll think you’ll have money left over but once the pending transactions clear, only then will the balance actually show what you have left. Every bank I’ve used will show an estimated balance that also includes pending transactions. Second, they have this pointless feature called “Reserves.” I was under the impression that it was similar to One bank’s pockets in order to set money aside for taxes so it would not be spent. However, I was told those reserves don’t count as separate accounts which is the case with typical banks so if you’re low on funds but have a transaction coming out, instead of just declining or over drafting the transaction, it’ll take the money for the reserves to cover the cost which makes the reserves totally pointless since it can still be spent as if the money is still within the main spending account. I have been affected by this twice as I had money set aside for taxes and an unexpected month subscription came out and took all the reserves. There also isn’t anything in settings to prevent this by having transactions rejected rather than automatically using reserves. Reserves are basically pointless.Even switching your DBA or business name is an extended process. You’re supposedly able to change that information yourself and upload proof of business ownership but you’ll receive a message from a rep saying it can’t be changed but “do you want to remove your previous business name with your new one?”. DUH! Why would I go through the trouble of changing it myself and having to wait days for approval only for them to tell me it can’t be changed but then ask me if I want them to manually change it. The only positive thing I can say about this bank is that you can contact customer support directly in the app and they’re pretty quick to respond but I would hope so as there’s no phone number to contact them directly. You could argue since it’s a virtual bank, that’s a given but One and Varo Bank, two virtual banks I’ve been using for a few years do have phone numbers in addition to a customer support email. I know it’s hard finding a low/no fee bank specifically for small businesses as most brick and mortar banks include fees which I think is inconsiderate for businesses just starting out. However, I’d suggest using a different bank because Novo is subpar with very limited features. I would not recommend it to anyone.\n",
            " - Complete disaster.  Steer clear.I needed a business checking account for my one-person LLC. My needs are pretty simple -- basically, deposit a handful of checks each month, and then move the money via ACH as needed to my personal checking account.  Thus, my requirements are as follows: - ability to deposit checks remotely  - no minimum balance or monthly fees - no fees for inbound or outbound ACH transfersAfter researching various online business banking options and reading reviews here on TrustPilot and other places, I decided to open a Novo account.  The application process was relatively straightforward. I set up ACH transfers between my personal account and my Novo account (verify the amount of two small deposits, etc.) and then transferred the necessary $50 to the Novo account to activate it.  So far, so good.Next, I tried to deposit a check that I had received from my client.  Got the message \"your check is being processed.\"  The next day, another message: \"we were unable to process your recent mobile deposit because altered check.\"  No further explanation.  And no way to talk to a real person - all support communications are done via messaging in the Novo app. So after a couple days of trading messages, I was never able to find out just what was \"altered\" about the check (it was later accepted without question at the bank I went to after this fiasco).Anyway, I then deposited another check via the app. Got the message \"we have received your check deposit . . . your deposit will be available [7 days later]\"  OK, so this seems like it's working better.  But then, the next day, I get another message: \"Upon further review of your banking relationship, we have determined that unfortunately we cannot continue to provide you with a business bank account. We will be closing your account on [date]\"  Note that this closure date is one day BEFORE the date of the deposit that had just been accepted.  So now I have two questions:  why was my account being closed, and how/when would I get back the deposited money that Novo had accepted?Long story short, after messaging back and forth for more than 2 more weeks, I never got an answer to the first question.  All the support bots would tell me was that \"we cannot discuss the details of the account closure.\"  As for the second question, my deposited check was credited to my account, then debited, then credited again, and then (more than 2 weeks later) debited as part of the account closure.  The money is being returned to me via paper check, which they say \"could take 15-20 business days\".I should also note that while all of this was going on, I continued to receive a steady stream of marketing emails from Novo, letting me know about all of the wonderful features of my (closed) account, and all of the other different services they could provide.  Umm . . . no thanks.So I went into this experience thinking that I'd be fine with an online bank with no real-life customer support.  After all, my needs couldn't be more simple, so how likely was I to ever need support?  Well, I didn't count on Novo creating my need for support.No matter how straightforward you think your needs might be, I strongly suggest going to a brick-and-mortar bank (or at least a better online bank, though I don't know how you would go about finding and vetting one). Your local community bank (and even some large national banks) offer small business accounts with all the same features as Novo - no minimum balance, no transaction fees, no monthly fees, remote deposit, debit card, etc.  And if something should go wrong, you'll have a real person to contact.------------------------Update 1/19/21: the reply to this review from Novo couldn't be more ironically perfect: they ask me to contact them with more info via the mobile app . . . but of course, they've disabled my access to the app when they closed my account.\n",
            " - If you’re considering Novo Bank for your business needs I’ll just say this. DON’T!!! They hold your check deposits for over a week leaving you with no accessories to funds. They also have a 20 transactions per day policy for debit cards which is ridiculous. I needed to order inventory and my card kept declining although I never reached that limit. ALSO, there’s no way to talk to an actual person if you need help. You’ll have to submit a ticket and WAIT!! Get a REAL bank please because it’s garbage.\n",
            " - After having 20+ different bank accounts among all of my businesses, I really like Novo.  The mobile app is very user-friendly and intuitive.  It incorporates modern technology well and makes it fairly easy for customers to pay. I am impressed by the customer service too - every time I make a change to my account, there is someone on their end on top of it within a couple of hours.  They communicate with me constantly with status updates and when there is more information needed, they provide a link and a clear way to upload documentation online.  I started with one business in Novo and it impressed me so much, I have since opened a second account for another business.  Now...just add a high yield savings account and Novo would be golden!\n",
            " - By far, the worst business decision we've made. Our business currently has ZERO checks because we've been unable to order checks, in the 6 weeks that we've tried, through FIVE different companies. All of them (including Office Depot and Vistaprint) have refunded our money and informed us that our routing number does not match the account. Our guess is because Novo is NOT A BANK and we have to use the info from Middlesex Bank, although in all of our \"conversations\" with the Novo \"bot\", we are told to use the info we are given. How are we supposed to pay our vendors and employees with no checks??? We could send a check through Novo, but the last time we did that, it took almost 2 weeks for the person to receive it and we had to pay late fees because of that.  We are super laid back, generally relaxed, and easy to get along with. We love startups and fresh new ideas...Novo is not a good fit...Novo needs to stop the charade because they are causing harm to small businesses who believed the hype.\n",
            " - This was the absolute worst decision I made for my business.  You can't speak with ANYONE directly. They first have you speak to a bot. You find yourself trying to phrase your question 20 ways to the bot. Finally, they refer you to their customer service...be aware your question must be sent - and you do not get a response until at least 12 hours.  A lot of times the answer isn't what you asked at all. Nothing specific to your account. Sending a check directly from NOVO takes 10 business days.  You get updates on the check only to be told on the day it's delivered something was wrong- it shows up at my address instead of who I made the check out to. My employees so upset with me. There's a cap on how much you can spend of your own money a week- there's a weird game of trying to get someone to increase the amount (remember it'll take at least 24 hours for a response.) I have no idea who would actually give this bank five stars.  It's a bank with the absolute worst customer service ever.\n",
            " - Not a real bank, they’re like a middle man between you and a bank. No support! Be prepared to chat with a bot and wait days for a real person to get back to you via email. They survive off of finding ways to fee your business. I’m closing this account and looking elsewhere.\n",
            " - The other day, they lost all the money in my account. They said it was a glitch in their app. But when it was fixed, they just sent what was lost. Nothing with the app was changed. Now it’s been 7 days and the 2 checks I cashed still aren’t available. How am I supposed to run a business without money. Their support system is the worst. They want you to message them on the app and half the time they don’t respond. Please do yourself a favor and don’t sign up for Novo Bank. Sign up for a bank with a physical location. This bank has terrible reviews everywhere. I need to take my money out of this account before they go out of business.\n",
            " - Will not protect you in the event a business REPEATEDLY takes money out of your account that you didn’t authorize. Go to the SEC and file a complaint if this happened to you. They must legally stop transactions that are not authorized regardless of whether you had a business relationship prior or not. That is the LAW.\n",
            " - Novo Bank is NOT a real bank.  Do not put your money in this bank at all!  It is likely a scam.  You have no customer support. They continue to string your along with email after email when you request to have an actual number to speak to someone.  The number that’s on google only goes through an automated process and you can not speak to a person at all. Meaning there is no one really manning this online platform.  We have deposits that were available but all of a sudden it’s not available to move, and we have not purchased anything!  We were told it’s a glitch in their system, but in reality it sounds like someone has hacked their system and they have froze all the funds!  As a small business not having access to our money is insane, and not being able to get ahold of someone is crazy!  This is not a real bank! I encourage everyone to file government complaints through consumer affairs and go to social media to tell of your experience!  The ceo should be ashamed!\n",

            " - I have no idea how these are real reviews. Do you want a bank that you can only text and wait 24 hours for a text back and then you must respond and it takes another 24 hours? How about a bank that says they send checks directly - I requested several checks sent on the 21st - they didn’t get sent and delivered by the bank until the 29th. Two checks canceled because the bank said the bar code was incorrect. Novo says you can pay off your Venmo and PayPal however both have daily and weekly limits. This bank almost sank my production company.\n",
            " - Terrible. Simply TERRIBLE.  They reversed my check deposit 30 days later.  By that time, my original payer refused to pay me again. The bank has no agents. Just internal message system. You will have no email trace, no telephone logs to prove anything. I don't even this this is a bank, they are a middle man of sort that use a pseudo bank at the back end.BEWARE: Do not use this bank unless you are ready to part with all your deposits with no accountability, no emails, no phone numbers, no legal address.... basically nothing!  Guess what evidence you have to show to your lawyer, NOTHING!UPDATE: After telling me that they will look into this, they disappeared again.  As I said, this bank is garbage.

            " - I attempted to open an account with Novo bank because they advertised being small busines friendly. I initiated an application and submitted everything they asked for. I kept getting requests for the same information I already provided. This happened three times. I reached out to the individual who was introduced as my onboarding specialist to be informed they couldn't speak to me via the phone to anser any questions. They have no customer support people. If this is how they treat people trying to open an account I can't imagine what it would be like if someone has an issue down the road. I am staying clear of this bank and would recommed everyone I work with do the same. Real people mean real customer service and I would rather work with a small credit union or someone who will actually speak with me.\n",

I continued to follow up with NOVO via chat since they they don’t provide you any means to talk to an actual person and it takes days for a response and they have said they can’t reverse the transaction that went to a litera black hole.

I have never had and experience such as this one. I will not refer anyone to use Novo bank. When dealing with business.

The only way you have to contact them is through the app or by email. You can never talk to a real person on the phone.  And the way they respond to when you have a problem with something is telling you to read articles on their website (I already had!) or to suggest \"solutions\" that don't work with the problem you have.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Now I'm trying to get them to close my account.  I've been trying for almost 2 weeks now. I have emailed the email given on their website for closing your account. NO ONE has gotten back to me, and it is almost 2 weeks.

Regardless, after dealing with them for over a year, they decide \"To go the extra mile to ensure my account is safe by validating the account.\"   During this process I was unable to deposit any funds, however, I was able to drain my bank account to ZERO.  Thus, their commitment to prevent fraud is quite flawed. They've lost my money and a customer. On top of that, dealing w/ their limits and timeframes makes it a no-brainer to deal with a real bank like Chase, Wells Fargo, or any bank with a branch, just in case.\n",

I could go into how they let more charges go through, after I notified them of the fraudulent transactions…. I could go on about how they continue to send us emails about how our account is overdrawn, because of the fraudulent transactions!

            " - This bank is a nightmare to deal with. They originally opened up my business account March 2019 but I had an alternate business account at the time. I was planning on using this as a back up bank account to see how the service was what it offers etc. then in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns began. I am a small business owner so I started the process of getting a PPP loan through the government. In reading about PPP loans in the best Processes to go through many people suggested opening up a separate business bank account just for the PPP loan purposes. So my account was funded to the tune of $153,000. I did an initial transfer for the first draw to cover payroll for the eligible Time periods. Then in a matter of days my account was closed I know a great access to any of the bank Novo resources.  Their email support was literally nonexistent. There was over $81,000.00 in the account at time time it was “closed”. After multiple times the bank finally sent me a PDF file of a print out from Microsoft excel with the account details, no detailed statements and lastly the closing withdrawal they would not provide any further information as to who this was paid to when, what method was used etc. This bank is a complete disaster, they are crooks, I would NOT recommend anyone in business to use them for anything at all. Their support is nonexistent  and I am still trying to figure out what happened.\n",
            " - I was notified on Nov 9 that Novo had shut off my debit card due to attempted fraudulent activity. It would take 2-3 weeks to deliver a new card to me. This is way too long. After not receiving my card after 2 weeks I contacted CS through the app and a new card was sent \"express\" SIGNATURE REQUIRED. FedEx claims they delivered and I signed for it when I did not. Novo CS was not helpful at all in obtaining a copy of the signature, which must be done by the sender. I waited 5 business days between responses sometimes. The virtual cards they issue will not work with Gpay, and as a contractor the majority of my purchases are done at a retail location. I had no choice but to open an account with another bank and close my Novo account. The first card they sent me finally arrived on Dec 6. That's almost 30 calendar days I was unable to use the account. My new bank had a debit card to me in three days.This is not a real bank and you shouldn't use it as such.\n",
            " - Don’t bank here. All is good until you have problem. Don’t take the chance.\n",
            " - Novo is great as long as everything goes smoothly, which it usually does. When you have a problem and need to engage support all bets are off though.You can never talk to a person, and they push you to use the app, but you cannot track your issue(s) or often even get a response through the app. It becomes very frustrating.I have brought it up to support more than once but then I fall back into the same trap. It ends up just muddling whatever my current issue might be because there is no visibility into what tickets are open or their historical context, so support conversations are not clearly separated.\n",
            " - Novo decided to close my account on 12/1/2021, I ended up calling Novo off the back of my card with someone answering but then saying they can not discuss why and that my account was under review. I have about $800 in my account and have yet to see when they will return my money to me. The email clearly stated my account was closing on 12/1/2021. After emailing support over and over and continuing to get different stories and the run around I am upset as it’s so close to Christmas and I have kids. Novo really need ti get their act together and quit playing with peoples money. I may not be waiting as long as some people on here but I have an email that CLEARLY states my account is closed. I have screen shots of the balance and how much is owed me. Then going to reply back to me after leaving this review that they will send the check to my business address on file, for which I replied no they need to send it to my mailing address on file.\n",
            " - My experience would be better if I could call at speak to someone right when I need them. I hate having to wait 24 hours for someone to email me back. This is money and should be accessible the same as my BOA account or Navy Federal.\n",
            " - 1. My debit card was canceled after I tried to make a purchase from a business in Canada, which was not fraudulent.  I informed Novo about this immediately.  I was never informed the card was canceled.2. I was told a debit card was mailed, but no details about when, or how.3. I never received a debit card, and had to get back in touch with customer service.4. I was told to confirm an address to have a debit card sent \"express\".5. That card was never sent.6. Now we're over three weeks into this, and I still don't have a replacement card for my business.Would your business bank here?\n",
            " - I opened my first business bank account with Novo and only deposited checks from one client to the account. It was the first money I had made and then $125.67 was stolen from me by a Walmart states away. I did a fraud report and they did nothing to reimbursed me. I never used the card to pay for anything. I kept it in the orginal documents it came in and somehow my information was stolen. I'm guessing they have someone working in the company stealing information and using it to take money from your account using other company's as an excuse not to refund you.\n",
            " - They declined purchases and then put over 1k in holds on my account with no explanation for why the charges were declined and why funds are being \"held\" with no release date or explanation and they always say they are transferring you to someone higher or another department that never responds\n",
            " - UPDATE: **Today on 12/1 Novo did update my account to reflect the $500**I rated Novo one star because I could not give it zero. I will continue to rate this bank on this site and others so that everyone knows they do not care about their customers.  I transferred 500.00 from my paypal account to my novo account and confirmed with paypal it went through.  I see the transaction under my NOVO activity but it never showed in my available balance.  Its been 3 weeks and no one has helped.  I also like others here will file a compliant with also report fraud and file a complaint with the Federal trade commission.  Do not use this bank you will lose your money.  They respond that they will help but never do.\n",
            " - Three fraudulent Uber charges were made on my Novo business credit card.  Novo immediately notified me via the app of the fraud.  I verified that the charges were fraudulent and froze the credit card awaiting the issuance of a new card.  All good right!   After this initial contact I thought that Novo would refund the fraudulent charges as any other “Real Bank” would do.  There is no way to contact Novo customer service with exception of the message portal in the app.  It took days for them to respond and they said that I needed to contact Uber for the charges to be reversed.  There is no way to contact Uber customer service either especially if you don’t have an Uber account. (try it!)  I’m out $203.61 with no means to recover it.  I’ve since moved to another bank but before doing so I made sure that I could contact their customer support hotline and talk to a real person.  Additionally, I verified their policy of refunding fraudulent charges immediately.  Don’t settle for the new kid in town with the cheapest services, opt for a reputable “Real Bank” and not an online only type bank that is not FDIC insured even though they say their “partner” bank Middlesex is.  This is not correct! (check it out for yourself!) I’ve reported Novo to the FTC and Consumer Federal Protection Bureau to try to get my money back.Update: In response to the below \"Hi there. We're very sorry to hear this and would like to look into this further. Please reach out to the support team via the support tab so we can investigate this issue. \"  I have reached out 6 times via email and 6 times via the Mobile app since July 21 2021.  Novo's final response was this: \"On Wed, Aug 4, 2021 at 11:37 AM Novo Support support at banknovo.com wrote:    Hello XXXX,    We are reaching out to you today regarding your recent disputed transaction(s) that you reported to our team.

I've contacted these agencies to assist with the run around that Novo is giving.  I also tried searched for a contact support phone number and here is what I found:\"..Our support hours are Monday - Friday 9 am - 6 pm EST.Right now, because of increased demand for Novo accounts, we're unable to support phone calls for non-Novo users. If you have any questions, please email us at support at banknovo.com and our team will follow up as soon as possible. \"  Save yourself the hassle and look elsewhere.  These guys are terrible!UPDATE:  OMG the saga continues!  I have $0 in my account and someone is trying to make fraudulent charges on the account causing insufficient fund fees of $27 that Novo is now trying to charge me for! The only way to contact them is through the help tickets system in the mobile app.  I asked to them to close the account months ago and they keep sending me warning messages like \"Your account has $0 balance and will be closed in 30 days.\"  This was over 90days ago!  I wish it would be closed.  What a joke!\n",
            " - There is no phone number to call and if you need support you have to wait days and days just to get a response that they will look into it.\n",
            " - Novo closed my account. I contacted customer support through the app and the said they couldn't reveal the reason for account closure. I had no access to my deposited funds for almost two weeks then the account disappeared. It's been a couple of months now and MY ACCOUNT ACCESS AND MY FUNDS ARE GONE. My login credentials no longer work in the app. There is no customer phone support. The only way to communicate with Novo is through their app. But even that is not chat support. You have to wait, sometimes 3 or 4 days for a response. It's all very shady for a business banking relationship. I contacted Middlesex Federal (the bank behind Novo) and they were unhelpful, stating that I needed to communicate with Novo. I finally found an email supposedly for customer support but have not gotten any response from Novo yet. I will be filing a complaint with the FDIC in an effort to retrieve the funds I had deposited with Novo.PLEASE READ NOVO'S RESPONSE BELOW AND YOU'LL SEE HOW THESE GUYS OPERATE. I STATED IN MY REVIEW THAT I NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO MY ACCOUNT VIA THE APP...... (AND MY FUNDS ARE GONE)!\n",
            " - Horrible bank, cant speak to live people only email. Response times on email are 4-5 days minimum. They allowed fraudulent charges go through a card that I canceled(they never sent a new card after 3 request). They sided with the fraudulent merchant over their customer. Took the fraudulent charge as a business loss and closed the account. Businesses beware.Update response: i have already played your support email tag game and I am not interested in the automated responses 5 days later via your app support tab. You have wasted enough of our time and money. We already reported your firm to the FTC and we are doing the same with the Attorney General. We have also reported you to the local police department!\n",
            " - The online bank is decent but the time it takes to clear checks is unreasonably long, previous banks have cleared checks in 1 or 2 days, Novo is 5 days minimum.\n",
            " - Customer service is lacking no phone support .when I enter my account info on the back of card I get the message can't find account and email support. I emailed support and receive a message. Then replied to the message and it went into a black hole. I haven't been able to make a deposit in months. My business and lost money because I can not deposit checks. I am going to through the trouble of finding a new bank. This sucks. Heed my warning go with another bank.\n",
            " - Initially I thought Novo worked well. As our business grew I would hit payment limits which were annoying but after a few messages over a couple of days I would be able to send payments again. Four days ago I tried to make a payment and it was blocked with a non-sensical error message. I had made an identical payment (same amount and account) two weeks ago but this time, no.The support is non existent this time. I have called them and sent multiple messages. I get placeholder responses about how they're looking in to the issue but no one has an answer.Bugs happen and problems happen but it's how a company solves them the shows you who they are. There is no mechanism for them to do a manual transfer out while we wait for a bug fix. I currently can't get my money out of my account and payments to my shipper and to a supplier are on hold. I will miss an early payment discount and my shipments will not move which put holiday sales at risk.All I get told is to send a message in the app which is then ignored.Do NOT use this bank for anything business critical. Look at the reviews here which are not \"Invited\" and you will see a consistent story. I wish I had seen this before.When this is resolved I will be closing the account.\n",
            " - app doesnt work for scanning ID which they just implemented to deposit a check. Now I have a check but it cant be deposited and they are clueless. Customer service really sucks and you cant talk to anyone.\n",
            " - Billpay uses mailed checks even to major financial institutions. That's horse and buggy. My latest credit card payment, as a result, never made it to Capital One. Asked them what happened and they told me to consult my mobile app. I don't have a mobile app. I don't want a mobile app. I used the desktop app. Much easier to read and navigate. My little rural credit union has a more sophisticated billpay than these guys.Their response that their mobile check deposit is only available via their mobile app is ridiculous and has nothing to do with the issue involved here. Not only can't they run a bank, they can't read English.\n",
            " - Complete Horse $%^#&,This is a company that can't even answer simple questions about Features of their services.  The person I spoke with was illiterate and refused to answer simple questions and told me that due to security issues, that I would have to sign up and contact them through the app with any questions I had.  Don't trust them.  Tell me, if you walked into your bank and asked them about their features and they told you that in order to give you any information that you would have to sign up for an account first, how many of you would be heading to the front door and saying Adios Amigo.\n",
            " - IS NOVO STEALING OUR MONEY?after reading all these reviews I'm wondering  is NOVO Tapping into our accounts?All these reviews have the same story: money missing,  no communication,  no resolution....My Business used a different banking service that we were really happy with.  Like alot of other NOVO customers ,we only went with them because our bank closed and they were a recommended alternative. After a fraudulent 350$ charge on Oct 28th, it is now Nov 11th. I have had several return payments fees assessed due to my checking account now being unbalanced. Like so many others experience,  you can only message NOVO through an app. No phone number, and no customer service. I keep getting told that the issue has been forwarded to the proper department. I dont know to what extent my account has been compromised. I am going to look into a BBB complaint and I suggest others do the same. Its possible we can even explore a class action lawsuit. Contact me at elpescadorfishingcompany@gmailThanks.\n",
            " - This card is causing my business to decline dramatically can’t even use the damn card after 2 transactions? I Haven’t spoke to a human yet, you’re better off using Cashapp than this stupid bank\n",
            " - Novo bank is the worst bank. I requested a replacement business credit card months ago with multiple phone calls and never received it.Novo no longer has customer service phone service to talk with a representative. The only way to communicate is through an autobot text. There is no way to get help for banking problems with business banking issuesDO NOT USE THIS BANK!\n",
            " - The bank is trash i asked for 6 months about why is my account frozen i can't get a response...I have a business and I'm hanging by a thread ,I have contacted a lawyer to investigate this matter since novo or Middlesex  won't respond i was told months ago my account is being closed and nothing my money is showing available but their is no way it take 6 plus months to complete a investigation...stay away from novo\n",
            " - We had our account hacked and the only thing they keep telling us is ....it could take 120 days to see if you will get your money back. OH and since Mastercard doesn't report back on the status....Neither does NOVO. Its been 60 days already and I never hear anything from them. No money no emails no messages nothing! Do not use them if you ever get hacked you will not see your money.EDIT: I have talked to NOVO through email...on the app of course because that is the only form of communication with them..... I have over 600.00 missing from our account and I have sent numerous messages only to be told the same thing.... \"we have escalated this to a higher department, they will be getting back to you\"....Nothing! Do not use NOVO bank we are day 60 with no recourse.Update:We did receive the full funds after 90 days. still don't recommend NOVO.\n",
            " - After a fraudulent $500 charge they have been ignoring all of my messages for over a month now. This \"bank\" steals your money, then ignores you and does NOTHING to help you. I have been trying to get this $ back since August and am finally giving up. Bank Novo: I hope you enjoy the extra cash you stole from me.\n",
            " - Account denied.  When I asked as to why, I was told it was.denied for one of several reasons for which they could not clarify.  Was told i could re-apply using a different email.This seems to be a bogus operation with poor customer service/relations.\n",
            " - DO NOT USE NOVO BANK!  Everything was fine initially. Made a deposit without a problem. Received my debit card and used it for three purchases without incident. Then, out of nowhere without any explanation they notified me that they were closing my account. Contacted them via support chat regarding the reason for closing the account and they said \"We are unable to speak to the specifics around why your account is being closed\". WHAT?? You are closing my account but can't tell me why? Well, it's been 2 weeks and the account is still open but the funds are frozen. I am unable to transfer out my money and no further response from support. What a joke of a bank. Novo customer service is terrible. If you are threatening to close the account, then close the account and release my funds! DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH MY MONEY!(MY PREDICTION OF NOVO'S RESPONSE TO THIS REVIEW.......(Thank you for your feedback! We'd like to look into this issue further for you. Please reach out to support via the support tab in the app and we'd be happy to assist you further). THE SUPPORT TAB IN THE APP IS USELESS! Novo Bank is a joke if not a complete scam.\n",
            " - Absolute garbage service. Card number stolen and fraud text received. I respond and call back, sitting on the phone for a good 15-20 minutes going over the numerous fraud attempts made using my card number (physical card never left my possession). One charge was processed on my account and now I have to reach out to the store where the fraudulent charge went through myself because the bank won't. On top of that, I was advised to destroy the debit card because a new one was being shipped. After waiting weeks for the new card I find that it's been shipped to an address that's OVER A YEAR OUT OF DATE because my address change made in 2020 is still \"under review\" by the unspeakable incompetency that is Novo.\n",
            " - You can not contact anyone through the phone. The only way to communicate with Novo is through a texting / messaging service. I had a merchant steal $7,500 from me over a month ago and it’s been a nightmare trying to communicate with Novo to get it back. They respond maybe once / day with a very generic response and they can not make or accept phone calls. They can only reply through texts. If you’re a serious small business & have money to protect, don’t expect protection or communication from Novo. I am switching to Bank of America. Even though there is a small fee, they protect their customers and have great communication.\n",
            " - They closed my bank account for fraud. There was no fraud. They won't respond to my emails and they don't have a number\n",
            " - This bank is not effective for business use. You cannot use a check, you cannot get a cashiers check, you cannot wire transfer cash, and your card has a 5k spending limit. You can ACH funds, however, the transactions take 2-3 business days to complete. Most business owners don’t have 2-3 days. Also, getting in touch with someone to actually speak with is very difficult.  Do yourself a favor, and get a bank with a physical location near you. If you ever need a cashiers check or a wire, you’ll be set. With NOVO, these things are impossible.\n",
            " - I see my account was -$252 and i was concerned that my account may have been breached.  The staff took immediate action and comforted my concerns.  My account was immediately investigated and the issues corrected because of a merchants mistake, not Novo bank and I truly appreciate the immediate response.  Give Lady Lee mucho kudos from me and my family.Awesome Job Novo Team\n",
            " - Terrible bank. They initially always reject checks signed using a \"Unique Character Facsimile Signature\", causing a delay, then requiring you to resubmit the check upon contacting support. The check is eventually deposited. Also, it takes much too long for checks to clear. I'd reco another bank.\n",
            " - I deposited a 19073.00 check into my novo business account. They froze my account immediately after they cleared it 4 days later.  Two weeks later and they email me saying that there closing my account that Friday the 6th and mailing me a check for my available funds , which 19073.00 to my address. So ok cool they sent email and text I even called and confirmed they had right address on file. Here it is Wednesday the 13 th and my account is not closed and my money is still frozen !!!!!!\n",
            " - Thanks for being more accomodating as far as giving me more than enough time to come up with the money for the amount of my account being overdrawn. Most other banks probably would of allowed for it to go ten days before they closed the account. Also thanks for only charging me only the amount that went through that overdrew the account, and also for just paying that amount, otherwise you could of very well just rejected it. Also thanks for not charging me a overdraw fee, where as most banks would of hit me for $30 for that, even when they reject and don't even pay the item. So I would say for what you've done does deserve a lot of credit, especially since you don't even charge a fee for the account to begin with and then not to even charge an overdraft fee to at least make something off the account. Should I even wonder how you make any money or even why you guys want to provide these free accounts to begin with?\n",
            " - Do NOT USE NOVO bank. There is NO customer service line to call. Our business debit card was used fraudulently - no alert from them. I got our card cancelled, but they do NOTHING to credit your account. Oh - and there is NO PHONE number to call these people. It took them SEVEN days to respond to my request for crediting our account back, and then they want you to fill out this long form, and the email I got says it takes them SIX MONTHS to get that money back to you - if at all. Your bank card is going to get compromised (they all do at some point), and NOVO is going to do NOTHING about it. Oh - after we cancelled our card, which is what all of our bills are paid with....they said it will take up to six weeks to get a new card, and there is NO expedited service available. Imagine that ----no customer service, no rush, no credit back, and no fraud protection. They actually recommended we contact the Wal-mart and try to get our money back and dispute the transaction ourselves, because they don't really do that. We have changed banks - DO NOT USE NOVO - it works fine...as long as you don't need any support. And then they fall completely flat.Update - see their reply below to this review. Yes - my company DOES have an account with NOVO Bank. And rather than \"loving to look into this\" why don't you credit my account for the nearly $200 in fraudulent charges on the account, and do what a real bank would do and pursue a fraudulent charge review with Wal-mart instead of telling us that WE should try to get our money back from Wal-mart ourselves. This is EXACTLY their suggestion for EVERYTHING.... please use your support tab. We would love to look into this further for you. And then when you do, you wait days for a response, and the response is basically a bunch of work they want YOU to do because they won't. Trying to use their customer service tab is a complete waste of time. We have moved our money to real bank with real customer service.\n",
            " - In theory, I love the idea behind Novo. Simple, no fees, and integrations have been surprisingly available. BUT. There is zero support and I mean zero (this is why there aren't fees). That would be fine if simply receiving my debit card after sign up hadn't taken 2 months along with countless emails and time spent on hold just to leave a message. Their in-app customer support takes forever to get a response from (via email, 24+ hours later) and even when you do, it's the same form letter you got from the other 3 reps who replied to your phone call, email, and other chat inquiries (via email). To boot - my debit card doesn't work, just keeps getting declined. (nbd if you could call and talk to someone, right?) I have yet to hear from anyone in response to my 2 phone messages, email, and chat inquiry. Decided to just transfer our funds to my personal so I can actually use our business funds for business purposes (and even that's taking 3 days). Honestly, this has consumed more time than just paying fees at Chase would have cost me - which is where I'm headed now.\n",
            " - If you want fast access to your card look somewhere else. The account set up should take 1-2 days but it can easily take a week is they need any extra supporting documents, which is somewhat understandable. The part that got me mad is that it takes 3 weeks from when you finally get you account set up to receive a physical card.I needed to start making purchases with the business card and obviously couldn't. I contacted support when I saw how long it would take and there's absolutely nothing they can do. They can't give you a temporary card number, they can't do faster shipping, nothing helpful. I know this isn't the representative's fault, NOVO need to either ship cards faster or provide temporary cards to use on the meantime.\n",
            " - This bank is by far the worst bank I have ever  Worked with 1. not only did it take me 2 months to receive my debit card record I have positions that has been declined statement that as a credit card when in fact it should not be2.

            " - I recently began a new startup with my partner and tried to open a simply checking account with Novo. Let me just say I am extremely disappointed with this bank and would never recommend them to anyone. I was using this new company as a way of testing the waters before I move 1 or 2 of my other companies over. I dealing with them for only a few days I can state that I absolutely will NEVER work with Novo in the future.\n",
            " - I would not recommend this Bank to anyone. I made a deposit and they said it was a withdrawal and took a withdrawal fee and then said they couldn't see where the deposit was made. But my Cap 1 transactions shows a deposit and where they returned it after I called them about the overdraft. Then the customer service rep has a crap attitude and sounds like she needs to go back to bed wake up again and start over. How do you argue with someone when you are in the wrong? They won't handle another penny of mine!!!!!\n",
            " - Have had numerous issues with this bank since we moved over from Azlo. There is no daily balance shown. They will sometimes decline payments we make based on the daily balance that we can't see, but then do not notify us. So we don't find out until we have late fees and a bad rep from vendors.This month was the final straw. The most basic tie out for a bank statement (beginning + in - out = final) is quite literally wrong. Never in over 30 years of working with banks have I seen this happen.To make all of this worse, they have no interaction with customers. They used to use Zendesk for support tickets but now that has apparently been removed and all that is left is a chat bot - I tried to enter a question, but there's no way there's enough detail for anyone to respond in a productive way.I called their brick and mortar bank, Middlesex, but they require that you leave a message.This whole thing is beyond fishy.\n",
            " - WARNING!!!! Do not bank with Bank Novo and Middlesex Federal Savings, F.A.?  They closed our account without a warning. This happened in August 2021. You can only communicate with them through the app and when they close your account you cannot log in to communicate with them. When you email the email always says login and you can't. They stole $550 of our money. The tech support said they would mail us a check and never did.\n",
            " - Closed my account without warning and was not in violation of terms. Withdrew a very large sum of money without my permission and won’t give me details where it was sent. Phone number on card automatically hangs up when putting in my account number. Customer support email is unresponsive. Essentially they stole a very large sum of money with no information where it went and won’t give me information. All done without consent of course\n",
            " - You have a successful run until you don’t. Just got unauthorized charges on our account, and it’s highly suspicious. It was an ATM card which has never been used anywhere, so there was no ability for anyone to get the number. So the only place this could have come from was their system. So yes, UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS ARE COMING FROM THEIR END. And now we have to jump through hoops to get our money back. We’re a small business just starting out so losing our money because a bank is not secure is terrible for us. I have to say, this does not make me feel confident in their product and have to do some thinking if it’s worth staying.\n",
            " - If I could make it zero stars I would.  What an awful experience this bank has been from start to finish.  I have finally decided to close this account after three disastrous months.   Lost new debit card.  Fraud claim with no responses or contact.   Replacement card is no where to be found.   I’ve have been messaging for days with no response.   I’m so disappointed and now the onus is on me to move everything over to a new bank.   Such a same.   With so many promising reviews I chose them.   I regret this decision so much.\n",
            " - I would leave zero stars. It took a couple weeks to get my account up and running. It took months to add my partner and get everything working well (due to 72 hour customer service turnaround and poor management. See below). Our debit cards have never worked. Their response was because neither of us activated them. The user experience on the dashboard leaves me feeling like I'm not dealing with a real bank. I recently sent my first check to a vendor. I received an email that said it had to be approved first. I never received an update on how long it would take. The whole process took over a week (vs. 3 days per other banks).You will NOT be able to speak to someone directly. There is no customer service, no 24/7 support. You can only send an email and it takes about 72 hours to respond. The immediate email triggered speaks to how they are busy opening accounts. This has been the process since March 2020. It's now Sept. 2021. I suspect it's a lack of support within the company. Regardless, at some point you have to shift to your existing clients. My accountant recommended a local bank. It took less than 10 minutes to give them my information. Then I go back and sign the paperwork on Monday. 10 minutes. I wanted a free option. My local bank has a free option as long as I keep $1,000 in the bank. NOVO is a disaster. I am a big fan of online banks. I have an online bank for a personal accounts so I know how efficient, well supported and cutting edge they can be.\n",
            " - Horrible bank and very disrespectful! A million agents by the phone just to do nothing but offer to send an email to a non communicative,allowed to lie robot that tells you everything is good to go and sorry for the convenience all because the company was closed to cal and verify or fix! Would not recommend! Restricted me from a purchase from using my account right in the middle of the purchase with no warning and no reason! What a way to make my business look bad claiming to guard my account from the bad guys but treating their own customer like that! This Jack is hitting the road! Never let the agent Lina tell you anything! She gives horrible service 😢\n",
            " - The variety of services, intagrations, and features are great, they get 5 stars, BUT, customer service is an absolute joke. You can only request help through messaging on the app or by email. Response times are usually measured in hours or days. There is no support number to call if you need help and they have a history of closing accounts with little notice and refuse to provide a reason. It happened to me, after they messed up a mobile deposit the reply I got back from contacting support was that they would be closing my account in 2 weeks.  If you need a dependable business checking avoid bank Novo.\n",
            " - Absolute worst experience I've ever had with a bank. We deposited checks and they were rejected because they said my signature was scribbled over. We contacted support to take another look but It didn't help. Three days later we got an email saying our account would be closed due fraudulent activityUPDATE: Novo replied after my initial review to let me know that they can not discuss why my account is being closed. What a joke!!\n",
            " - I opened an account with novo in April worst decision I ever made the account was randomly frozen it is now September. I haven’t gotten a clear explanation as to why and I have called every number there is to call gotten a lawyer and showed up to Novo’s office on 23rd st. It’s a scam.\n",
            " - This bank is awful! Just spent 5+ hours emailing, calling, and leaving voicemails trying to get ahold of customer service. I even called a different line and asked for a supervisor... she wasn't able to get ahold of customer service either! I finally got an email response with completely unhelpful information... guess I'll have to wait til Monday!The debit card they gave me doesn't work, so I have no way of using my money, and apparently no way of fixing that. I'm at a dead end and will be finding a new bank.AVOID. AVOID. AVOID!!!\n",
            " - Was very high on Novo initially. However, there customer service has become so freaking horrible. I placed a request for a replacement card July 2021. Here we are now in the middle of September and I've yet to receive my card. I've utilized their message support and have been given the same lame canned response of allow 20 business days to receive card. Completely ignoring the fact that the 20 business days elapsed, 20 freaking days ago. I requested a phone call which seeking more clarity on the delay and have gotten nothing. Due to their ineptitude, I'm now dealing with the arduous process of opening a new account with a different bank that values it's customer.Reaponse to Bank Novo reply:Your reply speaks directly to the lack of customer service that predicates the issue. The fact that you're unable to identify an ongoing, yet unresolved issue continues to speak volumes. For the record, I'm told that my replacement card is being shipped via FedEx and that I should expect to receive it in 3-4 business days. I guess Fedex no longer ships overnight. But hey, the original replacement request was made in July. More than 3 months ago. I guess waiting 3-4 more days should be viewed as a positive...smh.\n",
            " - I suppose, if no issues ever arose, and you can simply move your bank in and out of your account, then the low fee structure, easy set up, and useful app would be the end of the story, and this will be a five star review. However, issues always arise, and this is one of those tech companies that’s devoted to minimal human interaction, no real tech-support, no real customer support. Just bots with scripts. So when the inevitable happens, and something doesn’t work, rest assured, it will never work. If you are a human being that runs a business, my advice is that you should not ever use this service for your banking. What a tremendous waste of time, energy, and money.*** update ***Nearly a month later, and I still don’t have a functional debit card for my business account. Maybe this doesn’t sound like a big deal, but, using money to make money is kind of how I do business. Which is why I have a business account.\n",
            " - If I could give ZERO STARS I would. I have received 11 FRAUD CHARGES on my account - 9 from the SAME vendor and all internet companies totaling almost 2K IN ONE DAY. HOW was this not flagged????? You can't even talk to a living person or get immediate help. Do NOT bank with this company.\n",
            " - Be very careful before you trust your money with these folks. They let me open a \"business\" account but they would not accept federal tax documentation or my city issued business license as proof of an actual business. So my own \"business\" account could not accept payments made to my own business. Just stupid. So I asked them to close my account. It was virtually impossible to reach a real person even via email. I attempted 8 times. The majority of their replies are bot created nonsense. It took them two full weeks to close my account. I have still not received confirmation that they closed it but since I'm no longer able to log in I assume they have. For me it was a very bad experience and based on that I recommend that you bank elsewhere.PS: The NOVO Bank reply below is bot created. If they actually have a customer service department, no one from it contacted me.\n",
            " - They can't process transactions. Dropped my account because they can't pay SaaS companies like Adobe or Wix and I spent to much of my time trying to chase issues versus working on my business.\n",
            " - If you are used to any other traditional banking, be prepared for a slap in the face! Very very slow for today's economy! You have to wait 7 days to deposit a check and 3/5 days to transfer to your account. They can't even understand that there are others who want that cash!!!! On top of that, there is not even a phone customer service you send a chat and wait for days hoping for a response!\n",
            " - If you don't mind waiting 5 to 7 days for a deposited check to finally be available on your account, or waiting 3 business days for them to FINALLY start the transfer of funds you initiated (which then takes several days to clear, much longer than I have ever experienced with other banks), go right ahead. For me as a freelancer, it's not working out. I'm closing this account and going to my local credit union instead.\n",
            " - Was told i had to wait 20 business for a check because they closed the account while i was transferring money out it. Its been over 20 business days, now no one will respond to my emails and i still dont have my money. Once again they get on here say they will help but wont do anything.\n",
            " - What bank doesn’t want your money?? This one. It’s garbage.\n",
            " - Horrible experience and would never use this bank! 1. I sent a wire transfer and it never made the destination.2. I have contacted Novo 5 or more times via email and through the App.3. They keep closing the request with no resolve and no response.This is completely unacceptable from a banking service. I will report them to the Feds for mishandling of funds! Do not sign up with this bank, it's an awful experience!\n",
            " - I am sad to say that I have been forced to report Novo to the Federal Reserve. I had 2 fraudulent charges to my account in April. I reported them and heard nothing for months. When I contacted the bank, they told me they have 120 days to investigate and there was nothing they could do until that time passed. Over 120 days went by and still I heard nothing. I contacted the bank again and was told they would check with the dispute department and get back to me. Another week went by and still nothing. I sent more messages asking for an update and a phone number where I could speak with a person. Another week went by with me writing every few days and calling the number on the back of my debit card and leaving voicemails. At this point, I decided to report the bank as they were not returning my calls or messages. They did finally send me a message saying they got my calls and it's better to reach them through the app than by phone. I replied that I've been trying to reach them through the app and no one is responding. At that point, the rep who sent the message about writing instead of calling closed that conversation and responded to the conversation with the other rep who had been ignoring my messages saying he would forward my message to the dispute department. I have opened another account with a different bank and plan to close this account as soon as the Federal Reserve finishes their investigation and I hopefully get my money back. I will never again use an online bank. At least if there are actual branches, I have the option to go in and demand a manager's assistance.\n",
            " - I have been with this bank for some months now I get paid through wire transfer and I never get my money like I'm supposed too it takes entirely too for for a transfer that is only supposed to take 30 mins or so .for me it's been well over 2hours and still nothing and I call the bank and when I finally get someone to answer they have no clue to what is going on .I came from also where i was getting my money fast to a bank where it takes 2 to 3 days for a instant transfer\n",
            " - I looked at multiple options to open my business's bank account and this is the one for me. Here's why:-No monthly fees (seriously, why do so many banks require a monthly fee, especially when you're new in business and may not have much income coming in)-Reserves. This is my favorite part. It allows me to \"reserve\" portions of my income into different buckets. For example, I have a tax section and when I add to this area, it lets me know how much money I have total in my account and the amount that is spendable (meaning the part that is not in my taxes bucket).-Customer service. They send you emails with info on how to use your new account in a palatable manner and when you do have a question, they are quick to respond.-Integrations. I have a Quickbooks and a Stripe account and I'm able to integrate both seamlessly to my bank account. You can also do the same with multiple other sites including Shopify.-Transfers. They make transfers easy from your personal bank account to your business one and vice versa. It lets you know exactly how many days before it is officially transferred as well.-Payments. You can make a payment easily to others through a bank transfer or you can make a paper check straight on the app.The only suggestion I have for the app is having a PayPal integration. I'm not sure if it's because they already have a deal with Stripe, but I take payments mostly on PayPal, so it would be easier to transfer if they had an integration.\n",
            " - I got rejected on trying to open a small business checkings account. the reason was undisclosed and according to support they are not allowed to disclose the reason. the suggestion was to just retry the application with a different email. I can see the novo account here on trust pilot commenting that they can help with denied accounts. this is a blatant lie and not true because I reached out to them and no help was provided. It is not efficient and actually ridiculous to blindly retry the online  application without knowing the cause. terrible bank.I am truly disappointed and frustrated.\n",
            " - I had an issue with setting up my business account. I was going to give up, but your website, team members and forms made it very simply for me to correct the information I needed to complete my application process.\n",
            " - Support is non existent. They always want you to send them an email or leave a voicemail to have them call you back. It's really tough to speak to a human. Last time I called the guy told me there were only 3 people on shift to answer the phones that day! That's insane! My initial hold times to speak with someone always exceeded 15 minutes.No option for rushed debit card, so wait for a new card was 15 days. I had two accounts with them and they claimed to have sent me a new card that I needed for one of them back in May. I never got it, got lost in the mail.As others have said, this account is super easy to set up online and if you're opening a bunch of accounts as some people do, it's fine. The online experience is pretty good. But there is essentially no support -- online, on the phone or by chat.\n",
            " - I've been with Novo for about 1.5 years.The setup went smoothly and their web interface is clean and simple.  WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT EVER.After one year I tried transferring funds from my already established banking connection.  I got an error asking me to try again.  I keep trying and 1 month later I still cannot transfer funds into my bank novo account (even though I was able to previously)The worst part is Bank Novo's horrible, fragmented support system.  They hit you with auto support emails and support bots that are useless.  Many provided links lead to empty pages.  (They are attempting to automate and spend as little money on support possible and it's to their own demise. I will not be tolerating this nonsense much longer.)Finally, when I finally got what seemed like a real human emailing me back they were utterly useless.  At one point this person emailed me to tell me to:\"We would recommend reaching out to their support team for further assistance.\"\"their support\"?   I contacted banknovo.com for help and the support email is clearly coming from a banknovo.com email address.  What on earth could \"their support\" be referring to.  Is this some kind of joke?There is something horribly wrong with bank novo's support.I will most likely close my account and not look back.If I cannot fund my account myself and their support is not willing to rectify this situation there is no point in me having my Bank Novo account, I'll simply have to find another online business banking solution.\n",
            " - When I opened my account, it took 5 weeks to get a debit card mailed to me. OK, things happen, I will give them chance. I did get my debit card about 5 weeks after opening an account. Less than 2 months later here we are, today... I initiated a bank transfer from an external bank to NovoBank last week. Today, more than 7 days later, no deposit posted to my Novo account. I contacted my external (personal) bank, and within a few minutes I spoke to someone, and verified that the transfer was processed and completed from the originating bank, and I should contact the destination bank (Novo). I tried to contact support and got no response. I emailed support a second time and got no response, but they immediately closed the ticket, no reply or response. I tried to call Novo Bank and sat on hold for 30 minutes, to have an automated system tell me no one is available, leave a voicemail. I left a voicemail, and got no response back. I have no access to my money. I have failing auto-payments and NOT A SINGLE RESPONSE FROM NOVOBANK. I spent the entire day searching for a new bank. At this point, I am going through hassle of changing banks, and since I have so many accounts linked to Novo, it will a HUGE inconvenience. NOVOBANK SUCKS!! STAY AWAY!!\n",
            " - I've used Novo for a few months as the main bank for my business. I live in an area where my \"brick and mortar\" business banking options are limited. Everything I've done with Novo has been smooth as silk - funded the account, got a debit card, setup paypal and venmo with the account, everything has \"just worked\". Would recommend to anyone.\n",
            " - I did a little research and decided to open up a business account funded my account Through my personal checking account and a day after the funds were withdrawn I attempted to log into the Novo app and wasn’t able to, afterwards I received an email about my account being closed with no explanation, I replied to the email requesting an explanation and my funds back however have not received any response at this point this seems completely illegitimate and I will be filing a claim with the Better Business Bureau.\n",

            " - Do not bank with this bank.  We found some unauthorized charges on our account and the bank requires you to give them proof that you called the merchant and tried to resolve the situation....HUH, LOL, there is no bank that requires this anywhere in the world.   Oh, but that's not the best part, the best part is it takes minimum 4 months to get refunded. Think about this, if it happened in August you would see the money back in December, maybe, at best case scenario. Run from this bank.\n",
            " - Bank Novo has been amazing with helping me with all of my business needs. They treated me like a person and not just an account number.\n",
            " - OK, I'm New to Novo - already having problems. I received a wire transfer for a good amount of money. It took awhile for them to credit my account, and the moment it was credited to my accoount, it was immediately, mysteriously, debited, for a net of $0. It is Saturday and no customer service until Monday...No way to deal with an urgent situation. No one to call. Put in email message, and now waiting....\n",
            " - Worst business decision I've ever made was deciding to bank with Novo.  I opened up my account about a month ago and deposited 2 checks from clients.  One small check didn't clear(this happens from time to time in business) this must have flagged the account for review.  Ok, I understand, but that review has lasted a month now and they have frozen all my funds in my account nearly $10,000.  The customer service is terrible and only says it's under review and can't give me a time or date it will be done just to wait indefinitely.  They also say their partner bank Middlesex Federal is responsible for the freeze, but when I call them, they state that they only hold money for Novo and they would never freeze an account. So, who is reviewing my account?  I think this is a way to hold on to our money to use for there benefit.  Don't use this bank.The generic response I received below is a perfect example their customer service.  This company is no good, run!!!\n",
            " - On Monday of this week, I finally decided to change my bank for my small business. I found Novo, read the reviews and applied. My application was accepted and I was thrilled! Transfered all my money over (a mistake I now know not to do again), deposited a couple of checks, downloaded the app. Tuesday night, i was in the app customizing it. I wake up the next morning and find an email from them at 5:00 IN THE MORNING telling me they've decided to permanently close my account!!!!!!!!! Zero warning, zero reason, just closed!!!!! I was truthful in every answer for every question they asked. I don't understand why they did this. In the email, the said my money will be transfered back to the bank it came from, but when?????? I've emailed them 4 times (because you can't call unless you're a customer!) and haven't received one response. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!!!!I have business bills to pay. Automatic payments are beginning to bounce. I've worked my butt off for my business and now it's being very seriously threatened by these evil p.o.s.!! I've had a panic attack, random bouts of crying. THIS IS NOT OKAY!!!! ALL I WANTED WAS A BETTER BANK!! ANSWER ME!!!! Why would you do this without warning or reason?????? My business is nearly about to fail all because of these pieces of trash!!!! Are they going to pay for these fees?????? What is wrong with you?!!! Why approve my account in the first place??!!!!!DO NOT BANK HERE!!!! DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE!!!! NEARLY 3 YEARS DOWN THE TUBE AND THEY WONT EVEN ANSWER ME???!!!!I am so livid right now, I can't believe this is happening to me. If I've done something wrong at least tell me!!!!! BUT NOTHING!!!!AND NOVO, DON'T GIVE ME THAT AUTOMATED REPLY THAT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT!! \"PLEASE REACH OUT AT SUPPORT @ NOVOBANK.COM\" MY BUTT!!! IVE REACHED OUT 4 TIMES AND HAVEN'T RECEIVED AN ANSWER!!!UPDATE:STILL without access to my money! They reopened my account, but the debit card they sent me when I first opened it was canceled when they closed my account. So now I can see my money sitting there, but I don't have a debit card that i can use to spend my money. On Friday, they told me they were working to reactivate the card.Additionally, they're asking me to fill out these forms as if I opened a case about my identity being stolen, which  I definitely didn't. Has my identity been stolen? I have no idea, no one's communicated to me about it. But why have my fill out these lengthy forms, in which I'm asked to describe in detail my identity being stolen. What?? This is absolutely horrendous!!! Now I'm stuck in another place. Do i transfer all of my money out to my old bank account, which could take 5-7 days, or do I hope this all gets resolved ASAP?? I have no idea. I have bills I still need to pay, I only have enough shipping supplies to send out 3 - now 2-  shipments and I need to order more. This is a NIGHTMARE!!!! I want a solution TODAY!!!!! I NEED a solution TODAY!!!!!!UPDATE #2They reset my card Wednesday, which took forever but was great. Was able to activate it. However, on Monday, I decided to transfer my money over to my old account because I didn't know when they were going to reset my card. I did this by going to my old bank account and depositing into it from Novo. Was told it would be available today.On Thursday morning, I received an email saying Novo canceled my deposit into my old bank account because it exceeded their limit for withdrawals through the means by which I did it, which admittedly I wasn't aware of, but why did they wait until Thursday - the day before it would be available - to tell me this? Anyways, I thought it was fine because I could use my newly activated debit card. NOPE!! Went to use it at a sign shop and it it came up as DECLINED:BLOCKED. Guy said he'd never seen that message before.So here I am, almost 3 WEEKS without access to my business cash. Truly unbelievable. Thank the universe I've had enough payments process into my old bank account for me to cover some expenses.Imagine, all I wanted was a better bank. It's been nothing but a nightmare. Thanks a lot Novo!!\n",
            " - DO NOT USE BANK.My account got hacked- there is no number and support email is useless. My information has been exposed / leaked. I have yet to hear back from them. You’d think with this situation you’d be able to reach someone ASAP.\n",
            " - I opened a business checking account over a month ago, set up my DBA, which was confirmed by email and told I could go ahead and deposit checks. I deposited to checks made our to our DBA, only to be rejected, it said, due to the DBA not being set up. Each time I call, and wait a long time for customer support, they tell me it is a problem with their third party company who handles the check deposits, and they will fix it. They have now tried to fix it about 5 times, sent me agologizing notes saying it was a glitch in the system and that is now fixed  - This has happened 5 times and the checks are still doing the limbo! Its so absurd its beyond belief. Over 5 weeks later I still don't have access to the funds totaling 3,000 and need the money to pay bills. Now I'm stuck because I signed the checks for mobile deposit with Novo, and they can't be deposited elsewhere. And their customer support seems to be completely overrun with new customers and their issues. I highly recommend thinking twice about opening an account with Novo. They have put me in a really difficult place. Their people seem nice enough, but their systems, at least for check deposits, are incompetent beyond belief. Tired of the lame third party excuse.\n",
            " - I started my account, provided all the tax documents etc. Was approved, funded the account. Not even a day after the account was funded I receive an email stating that my account had been closed. No explanation, no response as to when my funds would be returned to me or how, or even why my account was closed. We are a military family and we typically only bank with military banks. This is my first experience with a nonmilitary affiliated bank and the last. Maybe that was the reasoning for the closure, who knows without an explanation I could imagine it could be anything. Maybe Novo is a non supporter, who know without a true explanation but for the moment that is what I am going to go with. Thank you USAA for being a great bank and NOVO could learn a thing or two.Also as Novo had requested I have emailed them multiple times. What does an email get you? An automated response with basic FAQ answers which it then asks if they answered your question. If not you respond and they are supposed to get in contact with you. They do not. I have sent 4 flipping emails and no response. So I am out now $160.00. Since they never respond literally my only other option is to file a complaint with the Federal Reserves which I doubt will do anything. People look into other options for your business as this place is not someone I would recommend dealing with based off of the customer service alone.\n",
            " - Novo Bank does not respond to customer service emails or chats in the app in a timely manner. They sent me a message recently saying that middlesex bank was reviewing my account and that my money is currently on hold. MY loan has already been forgiven and yet i cant even get a hold of my funds. This has been ongoing for more then 4 months now. I have over $5000 in the account but cannot access it. When i call middlesex bank they have no idea what i am talking about and admit that NOVO is a shady company and that they only hold the money for novo bank. I requested NOVO's policy for accounts under investigation or \"ON HOLD\" and they never sent a policy or even got back in touch with me. Countless emails and chats no avail. I have employees who aren't able to get paid because of this issue. Please do your research before utilizing this bank.\n",
            " - Bank Novo started out as a good bank.  Somehow my card was cloned by a thief at the gas pump.  I used my debit card as a credit card.   Somehow the debit card got into the wrong hands at the CHEVRON gas station in Irving TX. I have alerts set up on my phone and about 2:00 am my phone started dinging.  It was from the RACETRAK gas station for the amount of $89.98 and then a few minutes later my phone dinged again and it was from a 7-11 store for $100.00.  I immediately notified a customer rep that was very helpful with shutting my card off immediately. The problem I had with Bank NOVO was that stated that they could NOT replace my funds that were stolen for 90-120 days because they use a 3rd party company to try to retrieve the unauthorized transaction.  Other banks like USAA etc.. replace the funds immediately and then they do their investigation and then supply you with the outcome.  Bank NOVO has went over the 90 days and I have NOT received my funds back as of this day.  DON'T use this bank if you are in need of your money back after thieves steal your money!!The account is under my company name P. BAILEY MEDICAL GROUP, LLC.you should be able to find it now since you responded to my review.\n",
            " - The issue I'm having right now is depositing a paycheck. The first time it was rejected for not being signed although it was. I inquired if I needed to resign it and did not get a response to that question but was informed to resubmit it in 2 days. I resigned it and submitted it 2 days later, for the second time, only for it to be rejected again.\n",
            " - My overall experience with Novo for the past four months has been good.  However, I'm now in a situation in which I urgently need customer support because a domestic payee tells me they have not received an electronic payment.  I opened a support request eight days ago and received one response - which only asked me for information I provided in my original request.  Fortunately, the amount in questions is less that $200 and I will double-pay if necessary to keep my vendor happy, but I can't imagine running my business long-term with a bank that can't be contacted if something truly urgent were to come up.Update on 8/19/2021 - still not hearing back after reaching out to the support email in spite of the message posted by Bank Novo in response to my review.  Please look for support requests with my first name and last initial - or I could also update with a case number.\n",
            " - My debit card was declined for 3 days. it was the lifeline of my business. I could not call anyone to help me and I am disappointed in the customer service. I now had to reach out to another credit card company and that's not how I wanted to run my small business.I also hate that I have to write reviews and do this so i should be compensated for your failure in allowing a small business to run smoothly.\n",

            " - If I could honestly give 0 stars? I would. Novo has completely destroyed my entire life due to their negligence. Do NOT use them as a bank. They will refuse to do anything to help you. On July 16 I sent an electronic transfer. The money was cleared from my account by the 19th. But the recipient never received it. Novo repeatedly told me 2-3 business days. Not an issue except, it had been 4 business days at that point. On day 5 I heard the same. On day 6 they began closing tickets without replying at all on day 7 they told me to call the other bank because there was nothing they could do. Day 8-10 was the same despite the other bank not being able to track it. And now here we are on day 14 and still no resolution. This is a rental payment. I’m literally going to be homeless Monday August 2nd. I’m being evicted this weekend because of novo bank. Worst business banking ever.  Today is July 30th. Novo has not in any capacity even tried to feign empathy. Let alone do their jobs. I got more information from the recipient bank than novo. The recipient bank informed me novo could issue a dispute and launch an investigation and novo insisted they could do nothing. While novo insisted there was nothing they could do. When I asked for a trace, I asked it to be put through as urgent. Novo refuses. The following day novo informs me it was not put in as urgent nor expedited and they would do so. Repeatedly novo has played a game of tennis, bouncing me back and forth between them and the repoint bank like this is a GOTDAMN game. Despite me crying for 14 days terrified out of my mind I would be homeless? Novo COULDNT be less caring or attentive. They simply refuse to do their jobs and refuse to provide customer service. Do NOT USE THEM! If you’re considering novo? Your better off using a prepaid card and getting better customer service than Novo’s alleged bank. It makes no sense to me that they refused to do anything when the transfer could have been cancelled. Over 9 support tickets, and all closed without even being read or replied to. Every single time I opened a new ticket to get help with this issue? Novo chose to close it and ignore me. I’ve had agents say they will her back to me. 14 days later they haven’t. If I wasn’t calling every day? I wouldn’t even know what is happening. Did I forget to mention... I’m outside the states in a foreign country with no family or friends. A woman. And by myself. Being homeless in a strange land because your bank fails to do its job? In a GLOBAL pandemic? Does customer service get any worse than this? As soon as I get this resolved I’m closing my novo account. I don’t typically harbor hate for anyone or thing. But I truly hate novo. I think the people who work there are evil. How would they feel if they were at risk of being homeless? Come Monday I have no where to live. Thanks for nothing novo.\n",
            " - I did my research of available online banks that offered business banking and decided Novo was the way to go.  I applied, was accepted, was sent my bank card and I was preparing to transfer transactions and funds over from my Wells Fargo account when I received an email saying that they must close my account within 15 days.  No explanation.  I repeatedly asked for an explanation but the only response I could get was that that information wasn't available and there was no one else I could ask. My business is a small marketing agency that mostly develops websites currently and has been in operation for close to 30 years.  I can't imagine a reason they would have to deny my business.  And it didn't stop them from approving my application in the first place.  I find this rude and unacceptable behavior that they couldn't even offer a vague explanation for doing this and wouldn't do business with a bank that handles things this way.  I certainly deserve to know why.  I can't recommend them on the basis that you could go through all the steps and hassle of transferring your business banking to them and then without reason they can kick you to the curb. Unacceptable!UPDATE: I respectfully tried to work with the support team at NOVO through at least 4 persistent attempts asking for an explanation for their termination of my account. I will say they responded quickly and courteously, but repeatedly said they could not give me an explanation.  That's just rude, unjustified behavior.  So, now when I submit a review to warn others of this happening to them, they respond with an invitation to contact them again to work it out.  Sorry NOVO, 4 strikes, and you're out.  There are other banks available that would appreciate my business.\n",
            " - I was a verified customer and this was one of the worst banking experiences I’ve ever had. If there is no star, I would give it to them. They are bad news for small business which has no flexibility at all. Just do not believe the ad posted online and I regretted I trusted what it said about this bank. The worst customer service which their people have no knowledge of how they bank operates. If you have any issue, either they give bad advises or no reply...They claim to work for small business but honestly they don't work at all unless you are only a part timer who doesn’t care how much you are making or put in there and never going to take the money out.Limited fund transfer $5000 daily which they’ve never told you before you open the account. When they close your account, you only get very short time to get noticed and you won't even have time to transfer the remaining balance out. They will not let you know how they do with your money at once they closed your account. They froze my account days before the date they said on the email.Beware of using this bank because you will be sorry which I did and they still owe me $2000.\n",
            " - I'm a CPA and am trying to obtain READ access to my client's bank account so that I can connect QuickBooks Online to their account and download monthly bank statements.  There is NO PHONE # to call.  And the support people that I'm dealing with are overseas and DO NOT UNDERSTAND my request.  So what did they do, naturally close my ticket.\n",
            " - I have a business account with Novo bank. Deposit account services provided by: Middlesex Federal Savings, F.A., Member FDIC 1 College Avenue.Somerville, MA 02144 On May 21, 2021 two charge were placed on my debit card from AT&T. ($255.39 and $300). They were POS withdrawals in Texas. I was not in Texas. I live in California. Nor do I have any type of account or business with AT&T. On May 21st I immediately notified my bank of these fraudulent charges. After 60 days bank stated the dispute will not be credited because of the following reason: \"Denied - merchant has represented.\" The bank sent me a new debit card but has never credited my account. No customer service. They don’t answer the phone. App customer service is not answers. I have filed a complaint with the federal reserve and the consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n",
            " - Novo is the best business banking company.  Everything is handled for you.  My account is arranged for my sales, expenses, and miscellaneous items and everything is easily accessible.  I love that I can access my account online and on my phone.  It has helped me organize my business expenses tremendously.  I wouldn't choose any other bank for my business.  So glad I switch from my personal account to Novo.\n",
            " - IF I COULD GIVE THEM ZERO STARS I WOULD  DEFINITELY! DO NOT OPEN THIS  ACCOUNT EVER! 1622.00 MISSING OUT OF MY ACCOUNT, SHOWING IN THE  APP AS A REVERSE ACH FROM MY OTHER  BANK (VARO). UPON CHECKING VARO NEVER EVER RECEIVED THIS MONEY. IVE BEEN BACK AND FORTH WITH NOVO FOR WEEKS. THEY EVEN PROVIDED ME A TRANSACTION ID!!! BUT HAS YET TO LOCATE THE MONEY. AND THE FINAL ANSWER. WE KNOW ITS NOT THE ANSWER YOU WANT TO HEAR! 1000.00 DOES NOT JUST DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR!!!! IT WENT SOMEWHERE! NEVER AGAIN. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. AND FORGET A PHONE CALL. IT WONT HAPPEN. RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. I GIVE THEM NEGATIVE TEN STARS.\n",
            " - I opened a business account with Novo. Took 4 weeks to get my card. Every time I asked for an the copy and pasted the same automatic response. Now, I’m having issues transferring funds into my account the app will tell me it was successful but then the funds never post. I inquired about it and customer support said they have no record of a deposit…I took screen shots showing it was deposited. They don’t respond to my inquiries in a timely manner; it’s taken several days to confirm if my transfer was initiated. I’ve had nothing but problems with NOVO and will be moving my account to another institution.\n",
            " - I would give 0 starts if I could. Horrible experience, just horrible. You would not believe how unprofessional and incompetent they are and how terrible of a customer service they will give you. I regret ever setting up an account with Novo. They are so great in marketing and getting you to believe in them being on the customer side and really helping you grow your business but in reality it is all false promises, delays after delays, terrible customer support always giving a templated copy pasted response that \" we appreciate your feedback, we're working on resolving this\" yet 6 weeks later, yes 6 weeks, still the same issues. They should be ashamed of themselves. Pure incompetence. Don't make the mistake of signing up for novo like I did, you will regret it. I'm moving my business elsewhere.In response to Novo’s reply below my review: I have tried contacting your customer service 4 times so far with the same result every time. Them saying “we’re really sorry, we’re working on it. BUT we don’t know when you’ll receive your debit card. Our third party debit card provider doesn’t have shipping tracking as of today.etc etc”Has there been any new developments for me to try for the 5th time to contact your customer service or is it going to be the same result? Because I’m not interested in wasting my time any more to hear the same templated response from a “virtual” person. Thanks.\n",
            " - Customer Support is non-exsistent. Terrible on chat support. Randomly closing my chats and phone support long ass wait times. Actually, phone support doesn't even work? Each call says there's no support agents online at this time. Truly Worthless bank.\n",
            " - I open my account a month ago and still haven't received my atm card and no check.  How do you guys expect me to pay for supplies?  I had to link my Paypal account to make payments. Not cool. Not happy here. You are lucky I gave you 3 stars. No customer service phone number...... I just hope I don't have to dispute a charge with you. The positive note is that I was able to integrate easily with quickbooks. The app has many good features.\n",
            " - Novo is good IF:1.  You don't have account problems2.  You don't have to move large amounts of money.3.  You don't have to get your money quickly.Novo only has online customer service.  You leave a message.  They respond in a few hours with a stock answer.  You ask your question again.  They finally answer it.If you need to move over $5K you will need to ACH it in multiple transactions over multiple days.  Want cash? You are limited to $1000 per day on your debit card.Don't expect to move the money fast.  ACH (capped at $5K per day) takes at least 2 days.  Moving money in also takes 2 days.  There is no ability to wire funds.  There is also no instant funding.  Big drawbacks.In summary: if you don't need your money to move quickly and you aren't moving larger amounts this is the bank for you.\n",
            " - This was a good way for a small business to use that had a zero percentage on having no questions or problems with their money from depositing a check then bouncing. Zero help on customer support. That is a big issue\n",
            " - My debit card doesn’t work. The only way to get a hold of customer service is by leaving a message on their website or in the app. Then they have a day or two to respond. I had an open ticket for several days with no resolution, then they just closed the ticket as “resolved”. I opened a follow up ticket which was responded to the same day asking for the same information I had already provided in the first ticket. Nevertheless I gave it again. That was 2 days ago with no response so far. Banking is easy and pretty straightforward but if you have any issues, their customer service is abysmal and painstakingly slow. They even give the reason for such delays as being due to the demand for so many new accounts. This seems moronic to say the least. Don’t tell your existing customers that they have to wait for help while you onboard new customers and expect them to stick around. I have two business accounts and will be finding another bank to replace my Novo accounts.UPDATE 7/23: Perfect example of how this bank operates. Nine days after I post my review they respond. I still don’t have a working debit card and my card is supposedly scheduled to arrive on the 25th. Absolutely unacceptable. They’ve closed my ticket and marked it as resolved after sending me the following response in their last email to me 10 days ago.  Pure lip service with no action. I’m done.  We love receiving constructive feedback in order to better our product and company. I have sent this over to my team for review, and we will follow regarding this soon. We appreciate your feedback!UPDATE 7/28/21:  Still don't have a debit card.\n",
            " - UPDATE: I have been working on this issue for months now, and being that Novo refuses to work with me I went to the merchants myself. They have told me that in order to get any transactions reversed my bank needs to reach out. So when Novo says they have reached out to the merchants apparently they are lying. Lastly, when I reached out to Mastercard to ask how they came to their conclusions in this fraudulent case, Mastercard told me they do not handle any fraud investigations... this was literally MINUTES after Novo told me that MasterCard was the one who handled this fraud investigation. In short: the people at Novo seem to be lying about multiple things, and they will do NOTHING to help even when you call them and beg them to help you. Please bank somewhere else. DO NOT BANK WITH NOVO! After having my debit card lost and subsequently stolen, the process by which I had to go to claim fraudulent charges was confusing and stressful. In the end, Novo determined that I was responsible for these charges because (read the fine print) when banking with Novo you agree to their terms, one of which states, as long as each transaction is processed in good faith on the part of Novo, the card holder is responsible for these charges. Novo was also incredibly difficult to get in touch with, they did everything over email and even their partner bank Middlesex Federal, seemed confused by their practices and couldn't ever give me a straight answer.Long story short, go to an actual bank where you can speak with a REAL PERSON when something goes wrong. NOVO WILL NOT HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING!\n",
            " - My account is frozen and have spent 3 days trying to reach someone for help. No one picks up the phone, calls back or answers my messages. Actually my messages keep being closed and I'm sent emails saying reply above the # if you still need help. Three days!! Nothing and yes I keep replying I need help above those #'s.This is no way to run a business and definitely is not earning my trust or confidence. I liked Novo until they had zero customer service during a major problem. I'd find another bank if I were you if you are considering them.\n",
            " - I though NOVO was great at first, but now that I have an issue with my account it is taking days to get an answer to why my card keeps getting declined, there is no phone support and the chat service has to \"escalate\" my issue and won't get back to me in 1-2 business days and I called on a weekend. I have not had access to my money in over a week and there is no explanation, no email no phone call nothing! I am beyond frustrated. once I get my money I plan on closing this account.\n",
            " - you cant pay vendors or bills from this bank account\n",
            " - At first I was somewhat disappointed that Icould not wire money from my account. It still would be cool to do so but no worries. It turns out that in the end...I received excellent customer service. I was impressed at how fast and personal your reply was. I highly recommend NOVO BANKS.Hall\n",
            " - Where do I begin with this low budget no customer service having ass bank! First, every time I had an inquiry about my account I had to leave a message at which point I wouldn’t hear back for over 24 hours. Second there was no area on the sign up for a doing business as so after my account was started I attempted to put my business name under the doing business as on February 6 of this year it still hasn’t been approved and as a result has caused checks to be sent back to me bearing that business name because for some reason they never approved my doing business ass and now I’ve beenWaiting for over a week to hear back from them as to why they never put it on my account over a week!!!!!\n",
            " - I have a new account . My funds are in my account but my debit card hasn’t been sent in the mail yet . My rent is due and phone will be off and I can’t access my funds ..\n",
            " - Terrible. One thing they should make quite clear in their initial description during account registration is that you have no ability to send a wire transfer which in and of itself is a serious limitation. But on top of that there is a  $5k ACH daily withdrawal limit. I'm not sure how many small businesses can deal with these restrictions which are worse than pretty much any personal checking account.  I will be closing my account asap.\n",
            " - No support, no communication.  Can't access my money because they haven't sent my debit card.  Everything takes way too long.  Just opened this account along with a bank of america account on the same day, already have my bank of america card.  I now have money in an account that I can't access.    Tried to get help thru the support chat and no response.   Do not bank with them.\n",
            " - I have not received my debt card in the mail yet. It has been over a month and still no card in site.\n",
            " - No debit card, no replies to emails. I opened my account one month ago. I have yet to receive my debit card so I can actually use my money and when I try to contact Novo to tell them I don't have my debit card, I am getting no replies.Update: Oddly, right after I posted this, I finally received an email reply. to 2 stars for that. It seems my card was never sent due to a technical error. When/if this is resolved, I'll return to post a review on the actual service if I ever get to use it.\n",
            " - My experience with NOVO thus far has been great! Aside from me not receiving my debit card for my account, the other perks/services offered have been wonderful, I am excited about this business relationship's future!!\n",
            " - Absolutely NO support. Zip. Zilch. Zero. Joins the ranks of every other company eliminating support in favor of cost savings. Oh, email us you say. Nothing. Zip, Zilch, Zero. NO SUPPORT!Update to your response: Ha! Why would I have expected anything more than a canned response. Received your email. Does NOT address my issue. I wrote in the English language. I would leave a -1 star if I could.Update to response: My feedback stands. Truly a horrible experience and can not recommend you look any further at as an option for your business banking needs. Traditional banks offer better products and service.\n",
            " - I would give 5 stars, but I do not like that I'm only able to send $5,000 at most per day. I should be able to send as much as I want or have in my account.\n",
            " - Overall enjoying Bank Novo. I enjoy the \"reserve\" account feature. Very easy and helpful to use. The only challenge I have had is with an ACH Pull. I am not able to move larger amount of funds into my account. That takes a while to build up. I am able to initiate the funds from my other account and then send to Novo though. So it still works.\n",
            " - I started using Novo and was happy with interface only to realize they don't allow me to send domestic wire transfers. This has negatively impacted my relationship with my vendors. They also don't make it easy to take money out of the account. STAY away and work with an established bank.\n",
            " - Application process is long and tedious  (which I liked) as they require all of my business documents and information.  The debit card was suppose to arrive in 7 to 15 days and now 24 days later it still has not arrived. This is crippling my sales and I have no assurances about when this card will arrive. Novo provides no customer service number and the chat response time takes days. I am canceling my account today and I will be reporting them to the BBB just as soon as they are listed. Horrible company. Novo won't last long. Stick with a legitimate bank.\n",
            " - I opened this account over 1.5 months ago and after a long wait for the promised debit card it has NOT arrived. I can't get a straight answer from them and will be closing the account if I can not get assistance. Very Disappointing!\n",
            " - Most everything is relatively decent. I don't like how the account and/or business debit card are not eligible for instant transfers from PayPal. I also don't like the delay in processing transactions because it isn't posted until what generally seems to be the next day, whereas I would prefer an instant posting so I can verify everything is accurate. But the perks are good quality and its definitely what you want to use for an online store. Integrations are made quite simple. Overall A-\n",
            " - Silly that I need to ask for \"permission\" every single time I want to make a payment over $20k. Also does not support wire transfers.Would be nothing more than a minor nuisance if their customer support was more responsive. Usually takes 8 hours, complete waste of time.\n",
            " - NOVO is a joke.  First of all I opened an account for my business and I was never able to activate my debit card. I called several times told they would reset it so I could activate it. Nothing. Also, they never answer the phone and they have a ton of restrictions of deposit amounts etc.  It's really ludicrous.  They are NOT a bank, they're joke. I am glad I stayed with Chase and Bank of America even though they charge monthly fees, at least they work.\n",
            " - No customer service! It is absolutely impossible to get in touch with a real person when I started my account it started off good once I started depositing money into my account it went horribly wrong haven’t been able to get in touch with anyone to access my money for about five days now absolutely ridiculous!\n",
            " - ACH transactions, should be completed the next day, if sent by a certain time. 2 to 3 days is too long for a business account.\n",
            " - I opened a business account with Novo a month and a half ago. I have transferred funds in and out, paid multiple vendors, etc. Received a notice after bank closing today that my account was reviewed (by whomever) and it's being closed immediately. All money in the account will be paid out via check. Absolutely horrendous customer service. Account holders should have some heads-up or means to rectify any audit or underwriting issues that arise. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced, so beware before you bank with Novo.\n",
            " - I love this bank account so far!! It's super easy to use and track your payments and fund.  Its taking a long time to get my debit card so that's a bit daunting but it helps me to learn the account before I start really playing in it!!!\n",
            " - I have read the reviews about the awful customer service and I have to echo that sentiment. I needed an increase on my ACH limits, and, not only did it take them a full day to give me a response, my limits were STILL THE SAME. It took another whole day to resolve the matter, and the whole time I am having to explain to my business partner what is going on.  Let's put it this way, Novo's customer service makes Chase's $10/month fee like a steal. You mean I can actually talk to someone who will help me and I only have to wait on hold for 25 minutes for $10/month.  Sign me up!\n",
            " - Good online user interface. Opened account a month ago and still do not have a debit card, which has made purchasing an enormous challenge. It's almost not worth having opened the account. I hope the card arrives soon...\n",
            " - there was a transaction made but the recipient says they did not receive the funds in their account. phone support is needed.\n",
            " - Need help? Kick Rocks.What kind of bank doesn't have any customer service? We're not talking about a little or a small wait, we are talking about literally no customer service. Waiting months, 4 to be exact to be contacted about sending emails, calling their unstaffed helpline. I am not kidding there is NO ONE. Don't bank here, go literally anywhere else. So many problems caused by this small thing it's just not worth it.\n",
            " - Extremely easy sign up and a very user friendly platform. I was able to easily link my merchant account to my NOVO account. Add on the fact that there are no monthly fees, no minimum balances and free bank transfers to my other accounts and this is an absolute winner of a business account.\n",
            " - Your money is not secure here. This is my second review (you can see my first one on June 1, 2021) and things are not getting any better. For a bank, you'd think the most basic of functions should be to get your current balance correct. This is the second time in as many months that they have not been able to do this. On my current statement, the starting balance plus credits minus debits does not equal what they say I have. How hard is that to figure? And we are going on 12 days now since I have contacted them about this and they have not even acknowledged my query. I don't know what's going on with this place, but it sure does not feel like my money is secure at all.\n",
            " - Its been 3 weeks since NOVO closed my account with less than 24 hours notice, still no call, no email, no pathway to get to the money on my NONPROFIT Corporation account. I am at the mercy of NOVO. Beware of opening an account with a bank that's not, well, a bank.\n",
            " - Checks sent online take 9-10 days to receive...try explaining that one to vendors when most expect within 2-3 business days.\n",
            " - I was a former Azlo customer. Novo is a great bank and is very close to Azlo. The only complaint I have is that it takes longer to transfer from Novo to another bank account than it did with Azlo. I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for that. Customer service is outstanding.Update: I can understand if it takes a few days initially to transfer but after that it shouldn't take that long because your accounts, info., etc. have already been established and verified.\n",
            " - Having an account with Novo has been great overall for our business. I love their app and it's easy to deposit checks, pay the bills, and send and receive money. It took a while for us to get it set up with Paypal but that was Paypal's fault. There are a few things that I don't like about it. 1. When I look at our bank account activity, the account balance doesn't show on the same page. Also, adding a running account balance after each transaction would really help me troubleshoot balancing my account with my budgeting software. 2. So far I cannot get Novo to work with YNAB or WAVE, automatically importing transactions. These are two big negatives and seem to be basic functional features. I've suggested Novo add a running balance but that was 3 months ago and I only got a message back that showed they didn't really read my feedback and were going to forward it to the product team for review.\n",
            " - This is the simplist and, easiest business bank account I have ever used.\n",
            " - Recently had to make the switch from Azlo after they shut down and Novo seemed like the next best thing, but boy was I WRONG. They've let me down multiple times and I've only been with them for what 3 or so months. My card took a month to get to me and they rejected two IRS tax payments I made and charged me a fee even when I had enough in the account. Now I'm late for my Q2 payment because of Novo.\n",
            " - Terrible customer support and experience. Poor features and functionality.I came to Novo Bank from Azlo. Overall, I had been happy with Azlo as an online bank as we had few, if ever, any issues. With Novo, it seemed like nonstop issues. Their Transferwise integration isn't live on desktop, but is on mobile app. Whenever I needed support, I have to contact them from the app, not the desktop. Not via email. Impossible to get somebody on the phone. When a 4 figure ACH took more than 2 weeks to reach the recipient account, they gave me run around answers and an urgent issue that should have been handled day of took 8 business days. You can't have multiple bank accounts in one login, by the way. So if you have an accounts payable and accounts receivable... they require separate logins and applications.. which is crazy. And then transfering any funds between those accounts takes a minimum 24 hours... even though most other banks have it same day (as Azlo did). All in all, this bank is just not ready for the big time. I hate not being able to get good support when an urgent issue requires it. Their GUI is under developed, and their functionality just isn't really there.\n",
            " - 3.5-4.0 could be a 5.0 if Novo would process deposits/payments quicker. It's the only thing I don't like about Novo and I'm making payments into my own account at another bank, and it takes 2-3 business days. Novo needs Zelle or similar.\n",
            " - Few basic problems that I have experienced: Novo sent checks with duplicate numbers, and then rejected one of them when the checks were sent for deposit. Novo did credit the bank charges back, but it was a lot of hassle. Novo account website has a few useless visualization charts, but doesn't even provide an option to see basic daily balance. And check deposit is another hassle, e.g. if you missed writing exactly 'for mobile deposit at Novo', they accept it but reject after a day or two. And then you have to reach support for to be able to re-submit the check and it can take any time from 1-2 weeks before you can see it in the available balance. Customer service is quite responsive over email, but extremely hard to get a person to talk to. And no guarantee even if you talk to someone that they will do what they said. There is a max per day check issuance limit but they are supposed to allow temporary increase if needed, I tried multiple times to do that but haven't been successful.\n",
            " - Novo has been a better banking experienceI have been looking for an online bank that actually works well for me, and they have been very responsive as well as having the right combination of features and service I need. I use the Profit First methodology, and having different reserves really makes it easier than having separate accounts for each time of money flow. The main sticking points for me are the initial limits on deposits, where I cannot deposit large checks to my account without special dispensation. As a startup, my initial funding is in check form, but I have to wait for the amounts to be cleared before I can even deposit the checks. One other issue I have had is with them rejecting an account application without explanation. That has happened to me twice, but three other times, my account applications were approved without incident. The lack of transparency in that regard is a littel off-putting. Overall, though, I'd say Novo is far better built for purpose for today's virtual world, and I can manage my money more easily with them than with other banks / credit unions I've used.\n",
            " - Customer service would respond to my questions with irrelevant information. I cannot be in the app or online to send messages and my email is registered on my account but customer service would not respond to my emails. ACH sending limits are WAY too low. My account needs to be able to send at least $15K/day. Looking at switching banks ASAP\n",
            " - A few things are wrong. Takes almost 7 days for transfers to be sent to external accounts. BIGGEST ISSUE Applied for a ppp was approved the middle of april through novo and I still have not received it. It’s been almost 2 months. They say middlesex is in charge. But I applied through Novo so that makes no sense. Never received a debit card... don’t bank with these people THEY SUCK try lili bank insteadAlso, they respond to reviews like they’re helping. BUT NOTHING GETS DONE\n",
            " - Novo seems really great for my business.  Unfortunately, I have no way to access my funds.  The debit card I ordered on May 31st, has an expected delivery date of June 18th.  Its now the 9th of June.  I have to order checks, which again is 2-3 day delivery.  Novo doesnt offer instant ACH deposit, 2-3 days is the estimated time to receive a transfer.  Extremely frustrating situation.\n",
            " - I opened my Novo account after Azlo Bank went out of business and it was a seamless experience.\n",
            " - Takes a little longer then it should to post deposits to our account .  Debit card expired and still have not been able to get an answer on why a new card was not and still has not been sent.\n",
            " - The daily transfer limits are extremely frustrating. We only need to make 3 main payments a month but any time they're over 5K it's incredibly frustrating and has to be drawn out over a week or two. It's made it so that I must now look to transfer our account to another bank.\n",
            " - I needed a bank for a LLC through which I do consulting. I went back and forth several times with my credit union trying to setup a business account but the conclusion was that they wanted me to update charter documents which would have been highly inconvenient. I was able to quickly setup a Novo account with no issues. No problems were observed with accepting payments or using the credit card. About 2 months ago the due date was wrong on a preview for invoicing and I contacted support. They acknowledged the bug existed. I just checked and as of Jun 7 the bug was fixed. The daily transfer limit is inconvenient but I am giving this 5 star since I'm not aware of anything better.\n",
            " - I like that it's easy to use. Easy to add Payee's. I don't like that there is a limit per day to pay. Would like the option to have more than one card.Would like the option of transferring money to my personal account without it being a \"payment option.\"(this one is minor).\n",
            " - Please Increase my account limits. I have been trying to contact you for a week\n",
            " - It took a while to approve the account, but after that Very fast response after they approved the account.\n",
            " - Good system.  Service is lacking with no phone number or person to talk to.\n",
            " - this is going to be new business banking account and i am very excited.\n",
            " - The best experience ever had a business account with this company no hassles, no problems with setting up this business account or transferring money to other accounts everything is smooth sailing, the best bank I have dealt with so far\n",
            " - Seems to be a good bank except for the debit card cant seem to make it to me. Its been 3 months since they have said that my debit card should arrive. great potential so ill just say growing pains. ok otherwise.\n",
            " - I run a small non-profit and after trudging through the state and federal processes, I was finally able to get an EIN and a bank account, yay! Wanting to use a bank that had strong mobile access, and after reviewing and pouring over website reviews, we went with NOVO. Well, the experience didn't last long. We had a number of donations to deposit immediately, which went ok, however, one of our donations was returned as possible fraudulent activity. The check was in fact real and good, and it was cleared up by the donor in just a couple of days, however, with no communication, and given only 1 day notice, NOVO decided that a single hiccup was just to much risk for them. They closed our account (which was in good standing with a positive balance) with less than 24 hours notice and we were unable to access any of our funds until a paper check came in the mail. While we understand each bank has the right to choose who they do business with, choosing to stop doing business with an organization, then closing their account and removing access within 24 hours with no ability to access their funds is poor practice and irresponsible. I had to learn the hard way that NOVO is not a bank, they are developers who have a relationship with a bank, Middlesex Federal. You cannot talk directly to the bank when there is a problem with your account, you can only talk to an app developer...its a failed concept.\n",
            " - The worst on-line bank I have ever had. If I didn't have customers already electronically transferring funds into this account I would cancel. Horrible customer service. They don't have real people who answer phones. You always speak to robots and e-mails. Fake on-line robot chat service. Super slow check recognition 5-7 days. I could go on but I don't have time.\n",
            " - Terrible customer service!!!! Do not use this bank if you need a bank team that you can actually count on, I opened this bank account for my new business, Amazon FBA does not ACCEPT bank letters its must be an account statement, will Novo send me one? NOPE!!! LITERALLY EVERY BANK IN THE WORLD CAN GIVE YOU AN ACCOUNT STATEMENT UPON REQUEST BUT NOT BANK NOVO!!! AND IF YOU CONTACT THEIR SUPPORT THEY DONT EVEN ACTUALLY READ AND TRY TO HELP NOTHING BUT GENERIC ANSWERS!!!!\n",
            " - Everything went well with Novo for several months--as long as I didn't need any help. Sure the process to get a debit card was slow, and trying to get a second card for my business partner was a way-too-difficult experience. But it was when I tried to reach customer service that the wheels really fell off the bus. There is no phone number nor any live chat. Best you can do is message them. Then, it doesn't matter if you work at your desk for your job, their replies to your requests are only accessible in the mobile app itself, not the website. But the kicker for me was when my ending balance one month did not match the beginning balance the next month. I asked them why, and going on two weeks later and repeated follow-up, they still have no answer for me. When I can't trust a bank to safely take care of my money, no other features and benefits are worth risking my hard-earned funds.\n",
            " - A good second online option for people that want to have a basic internet business account. To make it a 4 star or 5 star online bank, better customer service (phone number), human interaction and availability of funds right away would be needed in my opinion. Over all and according to my experience in about a month of using it, Novo delivers its basic promises. I hope service improves, so that I can do more business banking with Novo.\n",
            " - It was going great for a couple months until I seen a transaction that needed to be disputed than now I can’t even get a full conversation with customer service they keep closing my messages and I have a lot of money in there for times like this I don’t know about this bank account especially if you have to pay employees & rent . The lock card process is bad any other bank it will be handled same day . Other than that it’s ok\n",
            " - I opened a business checking account and was surprised how simple the process was. Unlike other banks I've worked with, Novo was seamless and reasonable in all of their requests. In a few online steps I was successful. After using the checking account for some time I opened another business account. I have been very happy with the management of both accounts. If I ever need help I reach out to them electronically and I always receive a response that is both convenient for me and in a timely manner.\n",
            " - Still waiting for debit card two weeks after opening account. Long wait times to get minimal answers and excuses from an incompetent customer service team. Now Novo is asking for us to mail our first deposit check to their partner bank because of an error with the software Wausau for the mobile deposit feature. I've never had this issue with any other bank. What an absolute mess. Closing account ASAP. Stay away!\n",
            " - NOVO is SO CONVENIENT!  I can easily deposit checks and set money aside for different uses.I also have a debit card for business expenses.  This is great!\n",
            " - Update: \"in what seems to be a collaborated effort to misinform me and not allowing me to fix the real issue at hand, I still have managed to discover a lot for myself. As what seems to be a result of your team speaking with a fraudulent imposter who is jealous and wants nothing but to succeed in my demise, I was told by your staff my card was reported lost or stolen despite never doing so. I was told Middlesex is conducting the investigation but after speaking with Middlesex they are strictly the brick and motor bank for Novo and would never conduct any investigations into Novo bank customers.. which then leads me to the reason why I made the police report and FTC Affidavit and explains what I believe you're allowing to occurring here. I have sent your correspondents these documents as they pertain to this situation in one way or another. If we have arrived to a conclusion without taking into account my reports then nothing really matters then. I will be contacting Mr Tim S with Middlesex for more answers as I'm left to protect myself instead of putting my faith in the banking system...... I did file a complaint with CFBP which I've also sent to your team. 10\"I am currently banking with Novo Bank and have applied for PPP through them. In an attempt to get information on the status of my PPP loan that I signed with them, they have frozen my account with no reason as to why. All my money is in this account and is needed for business purposes. I found this out through my card declining! They have no support phone number and this is beginning to drastically effect me as my business will have to close down. This bank has ruined me financially and they face no consequences but I'll reach out to the CFPB and file a complaint!\n",
            " - So far the online business bank account has worked well and fits my on the go lifestyle, I travel a lot..., the support team knows their product well so any problem or questions get resolved on the first try. M.R.\n",
            " - I have had this account for nearly 2 weeks now. I still have not received a debit card. I still cannot get in touch with novo. I have various issues that need dealing with, And just love enjoying watching Novo respond to reviews within five minutes, but no response to my Support message. I would close out my account, but I have no way of getting in touch with anyone to do so. Will not be using this app anymore and hopefully one day my debit card will get here so I can get the money I’ve already deposited back\n",
            " - If you're looking for a lack luster UX experience, a garbage overlay that functions like a 2000s dot com era website, then this bank/app is for you! Enjoy not being able to increase bill pay daily transfer limits above $5000 (so if you have an invoice of $30K that you need to pay, have fun logging into the app 6 times - oh and did I say you have to do it on separate days (not within 24 hours)? Yep - that's right! You can only transfer $5000 out of your account in 24 hours. What a joy! Also - when you do transfer the money out, it still shows in your account as funds available, and doesn't debit the account for 3-4 days, so you really have no clue what your balance is. Did I also mention how amazing it is to wait 4 days for a check deposit to clear? It's such a joy. So my friends, welcome back to the 2000s, when boy bands and Britney ruled the world, Napster was still a thing, and website UX was garbage. Enjoy!\n",
            " - The customer service has been fast, and friendly. But every morning I wake up to 2-4 text notifications showing a code for my two-step authentication from the middle of the night 2:00-4:30 am. Clearly someone or something is trying to hack my account, which makes me nervous. This has been happening from the first day I opened my account. If you choose to open one. I wouldn't transfer a lot of money into it right away. I would absolutely make sure you setup two-factor authentication.\n",

            " - My business debit card Hasn’t been working for over two weeks now. I reported it as soon as I found out hoping maybe I would have access to my money by the end of the day so I wouldn’t miss out on an opportunity. Here we are two weeks later and it looks like the day is about to end (going on 5) with no fix. It’s embarrassing, I’m not able to keep my word because of my relationship with Novo. Gonna change banks asap\n",
            " - One of the most rewarding experiences were to open a business bank account and receive my business bank account debit card.  All happened within a few days.  I requested for a business bank account on a Saturday evening my account was confirmed opened on Monday within 48 hours then I received the business debit card within 5 days or so.  It has been absolutely exciting to finally have one of my businesses with its own business account.  Thank you for solidifying my business owner experience.\n",
            " - No customer service, ended up closing my account after 3 weeks, every time you reach out (which you can only do via messages) it takes hours to get a response.\n",
            " - I am/was in the process of setting up an independent Investment Adviser. My entity is formed, and I applied for their business checking account as Novo was was recommended for startups. I need to move my own investment capital into an account to pay for some compliance and legal consultants to help with my registration documents that need to be submitted to the State Securities Commission before getting cleared to do business. Pretty basic start up stuff, right? Wrong. Novo has now repeatedly requested a \"Certified Professional License\" at least four times. I've repeatedly responded explaining the circumstance. (There is no certified professional license. My individual registration can only be tied to a firm under securities law. Hence, I need to file my registration and both my firm and self will be registered concurrently.) I don't know if they are using a bot to screen the applications and I'm stuck in a loop, or their accounts department is just particularly inept. I will be withdrawing my application. There's ZERO real customer service. I have submitted all of the documents required by federal regulators. There's no reason this is problem, let alone an insurmountable one. If the experience is really this bad, there's no way I'm going to risk my business by banking with them. TLDR: Nothing is free. There's no way to solve a problem with Novo. Don't risk your business to avoid paying a few dollars a month.\n",
            " - I tried to apply for a bank account, but their system was messed up and said my scores were frozen, even though I unfroze them days before, and the credit bureau said that it was unfrozen.Edit: To respond to BankNovo, I already contacted your customer support, and they said they couldn't do anything because your system shows my credit is frozen... even though I was already sent my thawed report from ChexSystems...\n",
            " - I have had my account open a little over a month now. In that time I have had to reach out to support nearly a dozen times for one issue or another. I cannot connect my external bank account to Novo because it is says they are having “connectivity issues” that are never resolved. I also had to order a correction to my Novo debit card, which has never arrived. All messages I have sent inquiring about this issue have gone without a response. My ticket gets closed immediately after I post a question. Who is doing this and why? I am forced to send 3-4 messages per issue before it ever gets correctly resolved or responded to. Absolutely awful customer service.\n",
            " - I believe it is important for a fully online banking system to integrate smoothly with all forms of remotely operated money transfers, and to maintain viable options for legacy payment methods.  Example 1:  Novo has been unable to trace or review a traditional wire of $20,000.00 from Canada to the USA, which supposedly failed due to errors on the original sender's form.  I suggest that the oversight of such transfers should be equally shared between both the sending bank and also the receiving bank.   Example 2:  Businesses must often send payments to various government agencies and other entities, which may require more information than that which can be printed on a check.  In order to send an Oregon State business tax voucher that held information the office required along with my payment, I had to purchase and mail a money order.  Novo offers no 1st-party checks for their checking account holders, nor does Novo offer a way to add extra information or attachments to their bank-issued checks.  I suggest institution of at least one of three (3) options...  A. Novo provides a small book of traditional paper checks (perhaps 4, up to 12 checks per year) to their business checking account customers *upon request*, or...  B. Novo enables customers to upload a document file with their Electronic Bill Payments, which is printed & included with payee checks sent by mail from Novo, or...   C. Novo allows Electronic Bill Payment customers to write a sufficiently detailed note or memo that is printed in the blank space on the paper stub to which the paper checks are attached when printed & mailed.  Thank you!\n",
            " - Novo may be a fine enough bank if they accept your application for a checking account, but they do not have a transparent process when rejecting applications.My ChexSystems report came back clean, my credit reports are seas of green, with FICO credit scores bordering between very good and exceptional, and none of the other possible reasons they pointed to in general documentation applied (I hadn't opened any other accounts recently, had no bounced checks or involuntarily closed accounts in the last five years, no past bankruptcies, fraud, or identity theft, no outstanding debts or credit card bills, no late payments, very low credit utilization, had my existing credit cards and bank accounts for many years, haven't applied for credit recently, no complex business structure, not engaging in any of their \"banned\" business activities, etc.) In short, there was no reason given whatsoever or any indication of what source of information pointed to the reason, and I could not think of any rational reason why it would be denied. I would seem to be a model applicant, not a candidate for rejection. I have plenty of money in my personal checking account and investment/retirement accounts, I just want a separate bank account for my dba business for cleaner accounting.Note that this isn't even an application for a loan or credit card, it's for a CHECKING account. Of course they can still reject people for checking accounts, but aren't they supposed to give a reason? And wouldn't it usually make some sense?This makes a mockery of all the advice out there to find out why you were rejected and find a way to correct the problem (whether it's getting better ID or paying off debts or waiting a few months or correcting errors in credit reports or whatever). Without knowing what the problem is, I have no way to correct it, and no expectation that applying to the next bank will be any better (if, for instance, the problem is something in some third-party report that I don't know about which may also be used by another bank). I don't want to go making the situation worse by having a bunch of failed applications on my record either...They claimed they couldn't tell me \"for compliance reasons.\" I'd rather think they'd HAVE to tell me the reason for compliance reasons than the reverse... something feels fishy about this, and if not fishy, it just stinks. What bank won't tell you why they reject your application?\n",
            " - Terrible customer service. There is no # and the chat option is disabled so your only option is to email or leave a message through the app and they take hours, sometimes days to respond. I wouldn't recommend.

Does that make any sense whatsoever?I just want to close my account but it’s impossible:“We are informing you that if it is passes today and the process isn't take place, and any loan is successful made you will be arrested but we keeping getting back to you to make sure you are safe (…).”\n",
            " - I applied for a business checking account for my corp and was mysteriously denied, despite complete corporate credentials prepared by a law firm, and a long excellent credit history. When I contacted customer service asking for the reason for denial, I was told they could not provide any reason, and moreover I could not speak to the underwriter to get more clarity in the situation. Here is a copy of what I was told in their email:\"I just wanted to reach out to provide additional context around your application and the amount our support team is able to disclose. Novo works with our partner bank and we take many things into consideration when opening an account, one of which is Chex Systems Reports. These reports are not what leads to the decisions made by Novo or our partner bank, but they do provide additional context to applications. Our notice does require the contact information for Chex Systems as their reports may be taken into consideration for applications. During our review process, Novo and our partner bank user a proprietary review process and technology that takes our partner banks needs and risk tolerance into consideration.Novo and our partner bank do not take your credit or your credit history into review during our application process. As part of our partnership, the Novo support team is not always able to speak to specifics around the acceptance of an application. We definitely understand that this is not always the best experience and we are working to improve this process as much as possible.\"When I contacted Chex Systems and obtained a copy of their report, there was nothing at all adverse in the report. The Chex rep could not explain what might have triggered the denial. There seems to be NO phone number for Banknovo anywhere to be found. I certainly would not want to do business with such an evasive bank, and would recommend prospective clients stay away, until they get the message that they need to operate like a legitimate business with some semblance of customer service.I have also contacted the company who referred me to Banknovo and told them of my negative experience with them.Update: As for their \"reply\" below, this is another characteristically useless response from them! Caveat emptor.\n",

            " - So far I’ve experienced the worst experience. I was approved for a ppp loan & decided to have to funds sent to my novo account. This was last week it takes no more than 2 to 3 business days for funds to be shown in the account. Here we are almost a week later and nothing! I’m contacting the sba fraud department now! I was hoping for a better experience to have my clients all set up & ready to go. I hate to have to find a new bank or switch back to my old bank because I was so excited about using novo at first. I’ve reached out to novo’s customer support & heard nothing, usually they contact me back almost immediately. I’m over it. I hope we can resolve this because I was really looking forward to banking with novo.\n",
            " - Had no issues opening the account or transferring funds. I am however having an issue with trying to receive an international money transfer with the exact information I was given and that is on their website and the customer service has been lacking. I created a ticket and have had exactly one reply that did not help me (just giving me information I already had). I've since made additional comments on the ticket and have not received a single reply.\n",
            " - Absolutely the WORST experience!  If they had a physical branch, I would be screaming at the manager!The short version: I was approved for a PPP loan through Middlesex bank, and was forced to create a Novo account for the funds to be deposited.   That was March 15, today is April 26, still no funds, and no communication.  The ONLY point of contact for the PPP funds is a single email address, with no phone number.  Novo Support did acknowledge my concerns/complaints, but only to say that they could do nothing, because only the PPP group at Novo could handle the PPP process.  Over a dozen emails and support tickets, ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE from the PPP group at Novo.  I did reach a manager at Middlesex for help, but even her requests to Novo's PPP group went unanswered!  (I know, because I was copied on the emails to them.)I feel this is fraud.  They have held the funds for over a month with ZERO communication.  I have already filed a fraud complaint with the SBA for Novo's handling of the PPP funds.\n",

I’ve called novo’s customer service number and it sends me straight to voicemail I can’t get anyone on the phone and the one time I spoken to a live person they told me to call their partnering bank Middlesex federal.Middlesex federal denied having anything to do with novo besides holding their money. I haven’t gotten any information about my account from Novo or their partnering bank Middlesex federal. At this point I’m going to take legal action because this is ridiculous.\n",

I will be looking into having this bank in a legal matter and file a lawsuit for fraud and identity theft. I’ve had almost $200 worth of unauthorized transactions. All they can tell me is “check these articles” look at our “how to file a dispute”. They DO NOT answer their phone number associated with them. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCAMMERS YOU’LL EVER MEET. DO NOT GET AN ACCOUNT HERE.\n",
            " - I opened my account last month with Novo Bank.  All as been pretty well until as of late.  Many reviews above indicate great support, however I have been able to get NO support.  The only support options they have are email, chat, and phone.  Let's review them! 1. Chat - you type a question in and a bot comes back with nothing relavent to your question. 2. Get In Touch - turns you over to the messaging which then flips you back over to the Chat app.  We know how that goes..... 3. Phone - Don't waste your time!  When you call the number on the back of the card, you get a message indicating there are no agents to help you, please leave a message.While I understand , and LOVE, the concept of online banking, there will be times you need to discuss your account with an agent.  Currently I have a 5000 transfer pending to fund my account, however the transfer left my \"funding\" account weeks ago and I still do not see the \"Deposit\" into my Novo account.  And I'm not supposed to have questions about this?  I've tried all three methods above and well, still no response.  C'mon Novo, your customers need your help!  Step it up!\n",

            " - Worst Bank In History. My account got hacked and I can not for the life of me get someone on the phone. You would think that when they are responsible for me almost losing my entire life's work, they would be a little more urgent. They froze my account (standard procedure when hacked) but when I needed to transfer the money to my new account they said that they could only do a mailed check that takes 10 business days. I've never seen mail that takes 10 days. I tried to tell them that due to the nature of the business I run (insurance agency) that I could not wait that long as policies would start lapsing and my clients would not have coverage. I still could not get a hold of anyone on the phone. I finally found a phone number to call and they literally said \"I cannot help you I will have to email them and that could take 1-2 days\" JUST FOR A REPLY. I asked to speak to some kind of supervisor or someone that could actually take care of this for me. They have no one!! No one to take care of urgent requests. I can't believe a bank that is for small businesses doesn't have proper procedures in place to handle a fraud case. I literally haven't spoken to anyone other than a debit card customer service rep this entire time. It's been over a week since the event and I still have not had anyone that can help me reach out over phone. They are wanting to handle it through the email account that was on my COMPROMISED ACCOUNT. How is that secure????\n",

The customer service requests are answered and dealt with in reasonable time. Only time will tell, but for now we are very happy to keep the bulk of our money and our day to day transactions at Novo. I recommend you when asked by others.\n",
            " - I am attempting to get my small business up and running and to follow all proper channels along the way. After answering Novo’s MANY questions in the application process and providing all supporting legal documents, they finally approved my account. Only to close it the very next day with little to no explanation as to why. I am angry and disappointed and now must start all over again somewhere else when I thought I could finally launch my business.\n",
            " - Had a business Azlo account for 2 years with no issues. With that app being shut down, I needed to move elsewhere. Out of all the other free banking apps, Novo had the most advertising trying to take alzo customers to their platform. I applied and was denied within about 8 hours. Clean chex report, and no explanation from customer service other than \"risk tolerance\". Yeah a 2 year old business with no issues is a super risky proposition for a free checking account. Save your time, don't apply and go to one of the other, better free accounts out there.\n",
            " - Awful. Check deposits take FOREVER! Linking other accounts to fund the account has been impossible. \"Support\" is nonexistent. You get to chat with a bot and get open-ended responses that don't help at all. Calling the support phone number on the back of the debit card is useless. The only thing they really excel at is tying up your money for days at a time. I miss AZLO!! Closing this account immediately.\n",
            " - Novo provides quick customer service replies with ZERO resolutions. Impossible to receive a debit card from them. It can be especially problematic when paying your business bills and fees online and do not have a debit card to link. My problem is still unresolved after 2 months of constant communication with Novo bank representatives. Will be switching to a new bank soon if left unresolved and will report deceptive banking practices to BBB.\n",
            " - I too was using Azlo and then got the notification that Azlo was shutting down. I had to scramble to find a new bank so I saw Novo advertise as the new go to bank for Azlo customers. I'm a new business owner and I really enjoyed the no fees. Then I had a paper check come in and I tried to deposit it through the mobile app and couldn't. I notified Novo who then informed me they had a technical issue.  I'm not trusting Novo anymore to complete mobile deposits. I'll have to find another bank to use and then transfer to Novo.I also don't like the fact that the customer service does take time for responses, which I get, I'm paying for an online only bank.\n",
            " - I have had NOVO for a few weeks now and have had several issues. While I like the convenience, etc., I've had to get approval for deposit increases. When I signed up, I inadvertently signed up as a sole proprietor using my name and social security number, but I am a LLC with EIN. Since the latter isn't on the account, I have to apply for a new account. I can't do this because I would be using the same business e-mail address. While I do take responsibility for this gaffe, the most infuriating aspect of banking with NOVO is not being able to talk to a live person. All customer service inquiries are through email and I'm noticing you get canned responses as if corresponding with a bot. I'm really missing Azlo right now.\n",
            " - It takes way too long to get money transferred or anything else done. Can't get ahold of anyone to ask questions about the time to get paid or to pay my bills.  I've been charged with late fees every transaction I have made waiting on novo to get money to I need to go including my rent.\n",
            " - SUPPORT DISMAL AND SORELY LACKING. Bank has very slick web and app interface. Also integrates well with my mgmt sftwr, but that's where it ends. If you want physical checks to somebody sent it takes two weeks and the funds come out immediately. There was a problem with a small charge on my account and it was literally held up for a week because of they have NO PHONE SUPPORT. and Email/MESSAGING support is slower than molasses. Each Agent trying to refer to documentation that doesn't apply to the situation.\n",
            " - Easy to open an account, support answers correctly and in a timely fashion.\n",
            " - EDIT to original 2 Star review, 13 months later:I decided to wait a few weeks and see how things went. I'm glad I did.  I have several businesses. Some with brick and mortar and some with banks similar to Novo. Every bank has their issues, unfortunately. Novo's app is exceptionally good and easy to use. Novo allows ACH bill payments, which is huge for me. Some of these other online banks do not offer that option. At this point, I have two complaints still. The hold time on large checks are too long. Especially when a clear relationship between my account and the sender is well-established as evidenced by the number of transactions between us. This is further challenging when my account's average daily balance is significantly more than the checks coming in. I had to send a large, but substantially less than my balance ACH to a US bank and it took several days and was an unpleasant experience with the questioning of the withdrawal by Novo. I have heard several people complaining about that with various banks. This industry is changing, apparently. Anyway, I would now recommend Novo, just be clear about holds, delays, etc. Novo is better than two other online banks I use (SBB and LendingClub Bank). ORIGINAL REVIEW: Over 24 hours since submitting an urgent secured message about a security matter. Not even an acknowledgment of the request. Tried a second message asking if there was any other support options other than message through zendesk/the app and no acknowledgment thus far. They have a great onboarding process, debit card arrived quickly, the initial deposit took way too long - sent via ACH from another account, but not processed for a couple days on Novo's end. Unfortunately, this online bank does not operate at the speed of modern business. I have to move on.\n",
            " - I am having so much problems putting money into my Novo account through paypal, I am not use to this middle man function, slowingme down.  I wish somehow I could do it directly.\n",
            " - This company is horrible, customer satisfaction non-existent. I made a deposit to open an account with them.A few days later I discovered that they have no one to answer questions. I have made several requests since then to close my account for my deposit to be refunded. I am yet to get my money back. I encourage you to Not bank with Novo.\n",
            " - Applied for a business bank account through NOVO as many here on these reviews. it took the next day and I was denied. What intrigue me was that they use Chexsystems to provide them with feedback about my application and not the full decision of-course. I research and applied for consumer report after I was denied and they referenced the credit bureau, turns out I have no negative accounts and all the information on my Novo application matches exactly as that in my consumer report. They replied and said that \"These reports are not what leads to the decisions made by Novo or our partner bank, but they do provide additional context to applications\" and words like this \"During our review process, Novo and our partner bank user a proprietary review process and technology that takes our partner banks needs and risk tolerance into consideration.\" stay away from this bank seriously nothing about them sounds remotely true. Something here smells like a fish, how are they data mining all this data by directly advertising the Azlo closure so that all their customers move to Novo, just so that information and report inquiry stay on your file. Stay away!!\n",
            " - I have been with this bank for about 2 weeks now and at this rate, in my opinion they will not be around very long. Customer service is everything when it comes to a business. I opened the account using my legal name, then when I sent over my dba certificate to change my account to my business name because my customers pays to my business name  (dba) name not mines. They are giving me a hard time about adding my dba. So frustrated I went to a local bank and got a business account open using my dba without any issues. This bank is a joke. Then I get a ridiculous message from them in the early am hours like 1am stating - if I am changing my business name I need to reapply and open a new account. I am not changing my business name, I am adding my dba name to my account. Oh my goodness. Then you can not talk to a live person which is a big NO NO. No instant chat you get their canned messages bot for answers. Then they advertise human customer service - NOT...key to a successful business is great customer service. We are in the middle of a pandemic and you are an online based bank - you should talk calls or have a live person to chat with online not a robot, all of their phone numbers just puts you in a loop. You email them then have to wait for days for an answer. So those of you who are banking with this bank I hope you never ever need to speak to someone or if something goes wrong with your account and you need it fixed - you will be out of luck. I have seen business operate this way many of time and they don't last very long.\n",
            " - They missed ACH payments, lost money, there is no instant transfers even from NOVO to NOVO.They charge when you over draft even though they say no fees. PayPal cannot instantly appear in your acct, they hold checks for 10 days, they lose your money and say they have no idea where it is. They are completely useless and unprofessional, I messaged them many times with issues and was told... we are working on it. I gave it just over 2 months and I have never been more disappointed with a bank. My staff were inconvenienced by not being paid when they should have been, my clients couldn't pay properly, over all a very very poor banking solution. We came from AZLO who were fantastic but had to close. We are now with Blue Vine. If you want a bank that CARES, doesn't lose money and let's you do everything instantly DO NOT USE NOVO\n",
            " - What a HUGE WASTE OF TIME! They might be a good fit for some. Not only did I have to wait forever for my debit card after opening the account. One thing I never checked was if the debit card had tap to pay. It doesn't. Not only that, I almost threw it away thinking it was junk mail. I need batteries for my postal scale so I can't compare weight but it feels extremely cheap. If you plan on using the debit card much I doubt it will last very long. Not only that, even though I gave them my company name and EIN. They put my name down twice on the card and account and linked it to my SS#! Azlo initially asked for a DBA certificate when I started with them. After explaining that it's not a legal requirement for my State/County they were happy to open my account after giving them a copy of my federal EIN. Not Novo. After waiting days to hear back from support and getting a cookie cutter answer. I explained things like I did with Azlo and instead of understanding, Novo says they can't do anything without something I don't need anywhere else. I have accounts with several real banks. They don't require this because they don't need to where I'm located and in possibly can't legally. If there were no other options I'd look into legal recourse against Novo for false advertising and wasting my time. Instead, I'll give them the rating they deserve in  my opinion and hopefully save some other's some time and frustration.\n",
            " - Novo states that it charges no fees for customers to receive international wires. I EXPLICITLY double checked this before I opened an account (the exact response I received was \"We can confirm that Novo account holders can receive an unlimited number of wires, all with no fee for receiving.\"). Lo and behold, my first wire transfer received had $50 deducted from it. When I queried this they said that while Novo doesn't charge a fee, the intermediary bank does. THEN HOW ARE INTERNATIONAL WIRE TRANSFERS FREE? How does that qualify for the statement \"all with no fee for receiving\"? As a small-business owner, $50 per transfer is a LOT. I cannot believe they don't make this more explicit, especially when I asked them the question directly. Very disingenuous and reveals an alarming disregard for the small-business owners that they purport to be tailored for!\n",
            " - I applied for a business account and was not approved for it.  I was provided a list of possible reasons why my application was not approved, including, but not limited to, inability to verify ID, missing or incorrect documentation, high risk business type, prohibited business type, or information provided from 3rd party vendors. When I asked if there is anything clarification I can provide or speak with someone, I get the run around and no useful response for me to understand why I was not approved. I just want to know the reason why and if there is anything I can provide to help clarify any questions/discrepancy.\n",
            " - They have zero customer service!! Their chat is a joke and not at all helpful! They gave me this number through the chat: (844) 260-6800 where they don’t even say that they are Novo! How is this a real company!? I’m disappointed and will search for another bank now to take my azlo account to. Trust me, save yourself the headache and find a real bank!!\n",
            " - Do not open an account with them. Their customer service is non existent. I’ve been waiting for an international wire for a week now, when they say it should only take 2-3 business days. The foreign bank has confirmed the money has been sent. I provided Novo information to track but customer service has now gone silent and hasn’t responded to my messages in two days. If you do any international business beware. I even tried to message on Twitter which has gone unanswered. This is extremely frustrating. I’m an Azlo customer and was referred to Novo. Azlo was hassle free and Novo is nothing but a hassle\n",
            " - Maybe the worst support I've ever experienced from a \"bank.\" I couldn't get them to figure out how to remove a hold on my debit card, when I call their phone # for support their system doesn't recognize my account # and I can't proceed, and applying for a PPP loan has been a huge headache. To their credit, their CEO reached out to me directly to discuss their issues, although after missing his call I called him right back and we couldn't figure out how to connect. If I didn't know better, I'd say that the business was being run by a couple people out of a garage.\n",
            " - Very poor communication.  Does not respond to online request.  No phone communications available.  Denies the most basic business account without any explanation.  Don't use them.\n",
            " - There was some issues with trying to get money into the account at first to pay bills. A typical transfer process could have been explained. Everything after that first transaction has been smooth.\n",
            " - I started my business and was in need of a business checking account. All the banks I looked at has fees that would be waived if you met the requirements. Some had limits on transactions for their smaller level accounts. After some research I found Novo. The process to open an account was fast and easy. My experience since I opened my account has been amazing. Accessing your account via desktop or their phone app is a breeze. For me, the integration with stripe and quickbooks were a big plus. This is a bank that’s truly here for small businesses.\n",
            " - Novo makes it easy for me to separate my personal expenses from my business expenses not only with a separate account but with a variety of different tools and integrations! The Business Debit Card they send you comes in handy when I need to make in store and don't want to  have to transfer money from one account to the other because I only have a personal card. Whenever I have an issue, I can easily contact customer service or check through the FAQs to find my answer. Customer service is always timely with responding to emails and I've never had a problem thus far! They also send you emails about new features, upcoming federal holidays, or information to help your businesses! I've already recommended Novo to friends and business partners and I highly recommend that you see what this company has to offer!\n",
            " - Businesses often get stuck with high monthly balance maintenance fees. Novo offered me an alternative. No monthly fee if you meet their minimum opening deposit. In the hustle of starting a business, I can't afford to drop a cent more than I budget for into my general operations. I did my research and found no hidden fees. I asked a lot of questions. All Novo reps gave me friendly, straight, no-fine print answers. If the initial $50.00 deposit isn't an issue, this account is a fit. Novo's account is not without cons. Transactions may take longer than usual. I have had trouble with the app's sync to my Bank of America account, and my account information on the app isn't exactly user-friendly. But, hey it's a maintenance-free account, with a free debit card that responds to emailed questions in about a day.  As a starting business, this set-up fits my needs.Email may be a bit much, but they are wanting to improve. I can't fault that. Plus, if there is an issue and I bring it up to them, they fix it. That's what they did when my first debit card never reached my home. They canceled it, we tried again, and got it right together.\n",
            " - You have no option but to give a star.   When you sign up for this bank, you will notice that they only offer an email as means to reach out to them, and a message window that reaches a \"Bot\".  If you really dig, you may find you can call the number on the back of your debit card, who is not really part of the bank, but will connect you with them (at least, that is what I was told).Anyhow, after round and round I went.... I finally talked to a customer service person.  I told them I wanted to close my account, because the lack of ability to reach anyone, and the fact the company felt they have to hide how to reach them, did not make me feel comfortable or trusting. So, she told me she could not do ANYTHING to help me other than to direct me back tot he window were the bot answers....  and to make my request there.Well other than talking to a robot who can not possibly do anything other than to refer me back to an email (by the way, the same email.. I already emailed to).... There is no were even a physical or mailing business that I could perhaps old fashion write a letter to.DO NOT TRUST THIS INSTITUATION FOR  THE ABOVE REASONS.  STILL TRYING TO RESOLVE MY ISSUE.\n",
            " - Good product , terrible support. The support model is horrible , You can not call anyone, the number on the back of the card goes to voicemail. When you finally do get someone it takes forever to get through an issue using the support messaging . We have had many times that we could not get our money out to make purchases . Planning on looking elsewhere to do our business banking\n",
            " - The worst bank ever.. the number listed for lost debit card is not real!!the support chat bot goes in circlesI cannot deactivate my account..It's ridiculousAll false reviews.\n",
            " - Customer service is not prompt - want to handle an issue right away? Write an email and wait 24-48 hours. Then write them again and wait another 48 hours.  How about bank functionality? Simply put, fail...(you cannot wire money; cannot ACH more than a certain amount).  Fraud protection protocols are too stringent - shutting my card down consistently.  When I asked for a new card, there was a \"card shortage\" which resulted in not being able to access my money for weeks!  Novo is an amateur bank, useful only for those who need bare-bones service.\n",
            " - The product and UI is very nice but the Customer Support is really lacking. Their CS team typically sends automated answers that don't completely answer your inquiry. Usually have to send 3-4 messages until I get a \"real response\".I also lost my card and when getting it replaced they sent it to an old address after I confirmed and my new address before they sent it. This delayed me getting my card for about 6 weeks!!!\n",
            " - Opened my account this morning to find a $450 charge at a merchant I NEVER shop. Unlike legit banks, they did NOT flag this as a potentially fraudulent transaction and, when contacted, they said I had to go to the merchant and get some \"proof\" I'd tried to get the transaction reversed. After doing that they then told me it would take them 120 days (4 MONTHS!!!!!) to resolve the claim, that they would not credit my account, and that they might not ever credit my account for the fraud. Don't know just how involved their \"partner\" Middlesex Federal Savings is in this, but folks should not go anywhere near either institution if they're going to provide customer service that is equivalent to that of Seinfeld's infamous Soup Nazi. I will be closing this account out (apparently in April) when they finally resolve this issue.\n",
            " - This bank should be avoided at all costs, I have been repeatedly lied to about a debit card, they claimed it was sent in Aug 2020, never showed up, then they claimed they had 3rd party processing issues, then they emailed me and told me again that it had been sent, Nov2020 still NO CARD, this has cost my business to lose several customers, went to CHIME had account and card in a week, these people just flat out lie to you, terrible customer service.\n",
            " - If you are looking for a business bank go Azlo.Unless you don't care about privacy where me and another user we getting each other's messages because our name was the same.  And then you have a bigger issue with your money.2) if you are looking for a bank that supports you in the event of a fraudulent claim or dispute - these aren't the guysGet a bank that actually cares about your business.\n",
            " - I have only been a member for a short time but so far am very disappointed.  Customer service is terrible.  Takes entirely way too long to get your debit card.  There was an error on my address in my application, because I am what they consider a new account, they will not correct the address, even though I have provided sufficient information to show what my address is.  The website is very basic, there is no running total, just the in and out.  I have a pending deposit that has been pending for a few days, appears they are not crediting so they can hit me with insufficient fund fees as the money has come out of my other account 3 days ago - it should not take that long to be credited.  Needless to say I am in the market for a different more user friendly bank.\n",
            " - Customer service...none. Months to get a card...If you need help it is super difficult.  Wish I did not even have to give one star.  Truly horrible.  Any star over 1 or 2 must be paid by this company to leave this.  Go to a real bank or trustworthy option you have heard of before.\n",
            " - I wanted a more modern option for business banking. This product is flat out, not finished. I had issues signing up; it took me months to get a debit card, there are errors in the platform, and I can't even use my card. It seems like they did a lot of work on branding and then forgot they have to build a product. It's frustrating because I've been giving them a chance but I'm going to close my account. It's just one problem after another.\n",
            " - If I could give zero Stars I would this Bank does not care about their customers at all they have no one that you can personally talk to they don't care about shipping or anything they don't care how much money you have in your account they have no platform or anything so you can wire money or have money access to your money immediately and they're extremely rude I can't bank with a bot\n",
            " - If no stars was an option I would select it. I opened an account end of August. It is now mid-Oct and no debit card. I swear if I walked to their offices I would get it earlier. When i ask them where is it they keep saying this week. It's been 2 freaking months! I literally cannot run my business expenses. When asked for electronic card they do not have one. Also, their customer support reps are rude and totally useless ... shoutout to Linzi who is the worst rep I ever met and not willing to help. Instead she keeps lying to me.\n",
            " - Horrible BANK!! They stole $5,000 from me and won't give me my money because they are NOT a real bank just partnered with a bank that takes 120 days to respond! You can't speak with anyone, you cannot get any money bank and THEY NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN!!!!! RUNNNNNN FOREST RUNNNNN I BEG YOU\n",
            " - Novo customer service is about as bad as it can get. Their response time to an inquiry or concern ranged from 2 - 7 days, which is not great when you're trying to solve a problem related to your money. Once, within the same span of time it took me to exchange two brief notes with the NOVO service team, I ordered a shipment of tea from India that was shipped, cleared customs, arrived at my house, and was brewed into a tasty beverage I could drink as I tried to solve my issues with this low-frills bank.In my case, I had DBA paperwork with a confusing format. This format has not been an issue for any other bank I've worked with, but it presented a problem for NOVO. Maybe if I had been willing to spend another month exchanging the slowest emails ever with the NOVO team, I might have cleared it up. I don't know. I was trying to deposit checks and run payroll, so, you know, I didn't feel like I had the time.In the end, it was significantly faster to start a new bank account and deposit checks there, re-route my payroll provider to that new account, and process a payroll.Finally, when I asked for my account to be closed, I had to wait several days to get a reply that stated they needed to hear my reasons for closing before they'd close my account. 11 days after I made the request, the account was finally closed.This is a great bank if you are super into being frustrated by a customer service team. Like, if that's your kink, you'll love NOVO. If, on the other hand, you're trying to run a business, look elsewhere fast.\n",
            " - After banking for a few months, they closed my account, which is fine, because there are barely any functionalities. After, I could not contact them on how to transfer my money, into a new business bank account (At a legit bank, which I would recommend). Emails were answered with generic answers, that did not answer my question, calls go unanswered. Glad that my account is closed, but I wish I read the reviews earlier.\n",
            " - Expect ZERO phone support and days for a email or in app message response.  This stuff might not matter for you now but trust me, once your business is up and running any small discretion on the balance sheet, any duplicate charge, anything at all, you will have an EXTREMELY hard time communicating with them.  There are other options that are online like Mercury, AZLO, and a few more.  I haven't tried yet but hopefully they do better with support.\n",
            " - I’m so beyond irritated with this banking option.  They claim they are ‘fee free’, but they are indeed taking money out of wire transfers I’m receiving, denying they are doing it, and the ‘proof’ they are providing that they are NOT taking fees, reads as though they are.  Example:  the wire documentation shows the $$$ amount initiated to my account, but the $$$ received by my account is less.  So, I’m not a financial expert, but it seems it’s disappearing somewhere between them getting ahold of the amount and actual $$$ hitting my account.  This is only one of the issues I’ve experienced since opening an account with them within the last 4 weeks.  I’m so eager to move my business elsewhere.  And Novo, if you plan to respond to this, 1.). please do not use my legal name in the response 2.). Read  the correspondence I’ve been having with you/your team for the last month before you   regurgitate the same nothingness that is not helpful in finding out where the money is going 3.). I find it amazing that you posted a response in mere minutes after I posted this initial review, where as I’ve been waiting weeks for an actual explanation as to where the missing money is disappearing to...\n",
            " - RUN!GET AWAY FROM THIS BANK BEFORE YOU LOSE IT ALL! ABSOLUTELY THE WORSE ON-LINE EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. NOT JUST A BANKING EXPERIENCE, ANY ON-LINE EXPERIENCE. BASICALLY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. 9 WEEKS AFTER OPENING STILL NO DEBIT CARD. THEY SENT ANOTHER, 5 WEEKS LATER STILL NO CARD. C.S. REPLIES TAKE DAYS TO RESPOND THEN ONLY GIVE A GENERAL ANSWER TO MY QUESTION. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR RISK YOUR MONEY. FIND A LEGIT BANK.\n",
            " - This bank allowed me to put my funds in but didn't allow me to transfer or receive a bank card. When I called the bank no live person answered. When I email they respond in circles. It is my belief that this may be a scam. Please don't be a victim of this online scam. They may never return my funds deticated to my small business and as a result we may have to close😫\n",
            " - I have never taken the time to write a review about a bank, but my experience with Novo Bank was so awful that I feel obligated to warn others!! I have a very small business and opened an account with Novo in December of 2018. I'll admit that I was a little uneasy opening an account with such a new bank, but ultimately decided that since they were backed by Middlesex Federal and FDIC insured it would be okay. WRONG! The problems started right away. Everything from mobile bank deposit not working to getting set up with a DBA was such a hassle... and customer service was slow to response. However, the worst part was losing about 3/4 of the money in the account due to a fraudulent online charge at Best Buy (from an email address not associated with my account and delivered to an out of state address). Given this was such a small business (creative passion project really), I will admit that I didn't monitor the account on more than a quarterly basis. While closing out first quarter of 2020 I found a nearly $1,000 fraud charge debited from the account in January. After reporting to Novo, local police and Best Buy, Novo ultimately wiped their hands of any responsibility because the charge fell outside of their 60 day window. The most disappointing part is that had I been alerted of a suspicious charge I would have done something INSTANTLY! I have another business account with Chase Bank - anytime any purchase over a set dollar limit is made, I receive email and text notifications so I know this is a very standard practice. I sent several emails to Novo complaining that they didn't have this very basic protection in place. The ultimate kicker, Novo sent out a new product offering a couple months after the fraud on my account - they implemented a text fraud alert system.\n",
            " - Terrible customer support. Takes forever to get a message response, with no way to call. Had my debit card shut off for days, unable to purchase postage or run my business. Stear clear\n",
            " - I have absolutely nothing good to say about this Bank,  three times I transferred money from my other account and three times they reversed it making me overdraft.

            " - Great banking system\n",
            " - Do not bank with Novo for your small business. If you have any issues at all, their support model is horrendous and will create a significant risk to your business. I wish I would have read these reviews before \"banking\" with Novo. The tier-1 support available through the app is extremely limited in what they can solve. They can only escalate by marking a support ticket as high priority but this has little to no effect on the resolution. You are at the complete mercy of their awful support model. The affiliated bank Middlesex Federal Savings, F.A. can not help at all. From the Middlesex viewpoint, Novo is a \"black-box\" (direct quote).I'm very dissapointed that major outlets such as CNBC have recommended Novo for small businesses. They are misrepresenting what Novo actually is. Novo is an app with limited banking capabilities. They're much more of simple transaction app company like Venmo than a bank. If you are an actual small business with real banking needs, do not go with the vaporware Novo \"bank\".\n",

            " - My friend and I just started our first company and we were having the hardest time finding a bank that would take on our budding business until we stumbled upon Novo. They not only welcome small businesses but center them as a target customer, which means all of our needs are being met. Also the app design is really clean and easy to use which is refreshing. Would recommend to any and all small business owners!\n",
            " - Novo Bank is a great online bank for business backed by Middlesex Bank with no monthly fees. I opened an online account in minutes. Great bank!\n",

            " - We started our first small business (digital marketing) in 2013 and unfortunately, \"online\" banks were not an option back then. So, like everyone else we started a traditional business bank account. Everything had to be done in person and we (purposely) live in the middle of nowhere, which means it is always a hassle to have to travel 40 minutes just to do banking! Fast forward to 2021 and we started another new LLC and did not want the hassle of traveling to a location to start the business account. After researching the options we chose Novo because of the online \"EVERYTHING\", the customer service and the fee structures. We love it! We love it so much that we will soon be moving our first small business account over to Novo so we can take advantage of the online options and service!! Thank you\n",

            " - Novo has issued new debit cards without their customer service number listed on the back of the card.  You are forced to \"chat\" with a bot to try to get an issue resolved. VERY frustrating!  Horrible customer service.\n",

            " - Great banking experience!  You don’t feel like they are taking advantage of you like the rest of the goliaths. Customer service always there for you with a quick response. No physical branches but doesn’t affect my business.\n",

            " - Easy to work with and customer service is very responsive and efficient.  If I had any complaint its that they don't do checks and sometimes I need one to set up ACH for deposits with my business with vendors but other than that they are great.  They are starting to do small business funding as well.\n",

In my business journey, Novo has had my back since day one and I highly highly recommend Novo to all Startups and Entrepreneurs alike. Very very excellent service, customer service, help desk, integrated services, invoicing, and more. Can not wait to see what they do next. CEO - Mr. Young\n",

            " - A great alternative to a traditional bank.  Fast payouts and great customer service.\n",
            " - The checking system and customer service is terrible. I had a customer deliver a money order directly from their bank and Novo denied it.  I went to the bank that wrote the money order with the customer and they luckily they returned the funds to the customer. This happened a couple of times with smaller checks, but this was a larger check on a big account. Customer service at Novo said they can not tell me why they would not accept the check and my customer has no way to pay.  Stay away from Novo.\n",

            " - As they say everything is great, until it's not. Fraud on my business account, which was validated by Microsoft as fraudulent transactions in a communication to Novo and Novo declined to take any corrective action. Customer service can take days to answer simple questions and the bots they have in place to field simple questionslack any meaningful answers other than continuing to give you the same answers that have absolutely nothing to do with the question that was asked. Automated bots that answer customer questions based on information in knowledgebases are great when they are curated correctly and can provide useful feedback. Novo has a great deal of maturing to do from an overall perspective, especially in the customer service department. I would highly suggest seeking an alternative banking solution unless you like banking in the dark ages.\n",

            " - I would rate this company in negative stars if given the option. WORST customer service I have ever experienced\n",
            " - Not that great. The fees are cheap but you get what you pay for. The most irritating is the customer support. You use the app to post messages and customer support responds up to 5 days later.\n",

            " - This is the bank you want to have if your an entrepreneur. No cost, great customer service, and nonstop benefits.  I’ve been with them for almost 2 years now. If you see a fraudulent charge on your card, they will also fight for you and try to get the money back for you.  This happened to me twice.\n",

            " - Great service, and super easy app to use and access all of one's business needs. A must have for any business owner looking to invoice customers or just keep funds seperate from one's personal funds. Customer support was a concern it being an online bank, however upon receiving an overdraft fee, a simple message requesting it be waived as a one time courtesy resulted in a quick fee reversal. Happy customer here!\n",

            " - Great, could be better\n",

            " - I do not recommend Novo. I initially chose it for my small business after reading some online reviews and because of the lack of fees. However, the customer service is terrible. I had an issue that I emailed them about, and it took them almost two months to resolve, with me having to reach out multiple times via email and phone to remind them that no one had yet responded and resolved my issue. I plan to switch to another bank that is known for having better customer service - I now understand that it is well worth the investment.\n",
            " - Great Customer Service!I recently had my first issue that I needed to contact support over (fraud charge). The customer service team (Dante & Mark) were really, really nice and professional. They were on top of making sure I had everything straightened out. This is in stark contrast to the other experiences I've had with commercial banking.\n",
            " - NOVO has terrible customer service.\n",
            " - I’d give a negative 5 if that was possible. This has been the worst banking experience I’ve ever had. I understand that NOVO is not bank  and acts as a “front” but that should allow for better customer service. Well they certainly don’t get what customer service entails. My interactions have been less than satisfactory with the current issue now 7 days old with no response other than “thanks for reaching out…did this resolve your issue?” How is this support? That this outfit has no fees is enticing but let me tell you, in this instance, you get what you pay for!\n",
            " - Novo is a GREAT service for small businesses! The invoicing capability is fantastic, and the lack of monthly fees is so great for those of us struggling with the snowball effect of fees for every little necessity. I love this service.\n",
            " - Everyone at Novo is helpful, friendly and responsive.All banking functions are easy to use, the app and website work wonderfully. The only drawback is no 24 hour customer service but they were on top of it the very next morning!\n",
            " - Staff is knowledgeable of NOVO products and customer service is phenomenal.\n",
            " - It's great. Go for it.\n",
            " - My customer service representative helped me quickly, and ensured my need was addressed.\n",
            " - Consistently quick and effective customer service. I've contacted them on a couple of occasions with requests to change default limits for deposits, transfers, etc. and it has always been a good experience.\n",

            " - Excellent customer service. No minimum balance required. Fast transfers, withdrawals and deposits. They even reversed my insufficient fund fee that I accidentally withdrew from another account. I highly recommend using Novo over any other bank for your business.\n",

            " - From set up to answering questions this company is on it!   Customer service is the best I've seen in a bank EVER!  The response time is incredible - super quick.\n",
            " - Horrible customer service. I've been a customer for months now and it's not rare when I don't receive any news from customer service for days (5 days today a'd counting).Forget this bank if you plan on receiving international wire transfer, it's been 2weeks and I still haven't received my money. When you call them, nobody will pick up the phone. I'm about to call my lawyer if this poor service continues\n",
            " - Novo is a great company with excellent customer service and speedy response time. Easy set up process, takes about 15-20 minutes. I would recommend them to any business owner!\n",
            " - Their lack of customer service alone should keep you from banking with these guys. For one - they don't have a customer service line - they only have an email address. And I had something urgent come up early on a Friday one week and indicated that it needed to be taken care of THAT day. Fast forward to Monday afternoon, they finally respond to an email as though nothing had ever happened and I'm like - uh, too late. I had to take care of it another way because your customer service is completely absent. Whatever you think is going to make it worth it to bank with these guys - you're wrong. Go elsewhere.\n",
            " - Had a forwarding issue with mail and my card ... Novo got it all squared away for me faster than I could get to where it was being mailed to... A++ customer service and just an overall great company to work with\n",

            " - Novo has great customer service and a very good product. I moved to Novo from one of the large banking conglomerates to avoid fees on my business bank accounts and now have 3 accounts with them. They've been great whenever I've run into issues and really seem to care about their customers. They also roll out innovative features pretty regularly.\n",

            " - Easily setup, great customer service, and great app. Love that I can send invoices directly from the app.\n",
            " - We are one of the businesses that transferred funds from Azlo, when they closed. Novo was able to work quickly with us and make that my husband and i both had our own debit cards. The customer service team was very quick to respond and helpful.\n",
            " - The customer service and user experience is excellent. Really really excellent! Every question is answered thoroughly, speedily, and professionally.\n",
            " - I’m new to Novo but so far it’s been really good. Prior to onboarding I read comments about their lack of customer support. I reached out twice so far and they have great customer service. My only problem is it’s been well over 2 months and I still don’t have a business debit card. I know that’s probably not their fault during this pandemic. Outside of that superb service. Love banking with Novo and I love the inspiring quotes I get when I log onto my dashboard.\n",
            " - Well it’s a bank. The features are a little weak, especially the invoicing. But hopefully with growth comes more development and technology. Customer service has been great so far.\n",

            " - Im really happy with Novo. They have excellent customer service and  I love there are no atm fees.\n",
            " - By far the most frustrating bank I have ever dealt with for my business account. The app is great, but you can never speak to anyone if there are issues. You have to send email/DM and hope they get to you in a timely fashion. For business owners this is horrible customer service\n",

            " - Really easy to work with, customer service is great!\n",

            " - I have had my Novo account for almost 6 months now, and I have had a great experience so far! Customer service is great - I've interacted with them twice so far. My favorite feature is the Online Banking portal - the interface is simple, minimalist, and intuitive. They have some great intergrations that I hope to use once I need them, like Shopify, and Stripe. Overall, I give them two thumbs up!\n"
